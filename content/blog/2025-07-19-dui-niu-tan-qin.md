**Pronunciation:** *duì niú tán qín*  
**Literal meaning:** Play zither to cow

## Origin & Usage

This satirical idiom describes playing (弹) the guqin zither (琴) to (对) a cow (牛), originating from the Warring States period. Historical records attribute it to musician Gongming Yi, who attempted to perform sophisticated melodies for a cow that continued grazing, completely indifferent to the refined music. During the Han Dynasty, it became a standard metaphor in texts discussing audience appropriateness in communication. The specific reference to the guqin was meaningful as this instrument represented the height of cultural refinement. Unlike terms for general misunderstanding, it specifically describes sophisticated expression wasted on an unreceptive audience. Modern usage emphasizes the mismatch between advanced content and unprepared recipients.

## Examples

**English:** "The professor's advanced theory completely confused the elementary students"
