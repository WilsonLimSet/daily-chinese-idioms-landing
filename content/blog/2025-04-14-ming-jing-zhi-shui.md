**Pronunciation:** *míng jìng zhǐ shuǐ*  
**Literal meaning:** Clear mirror still water

## Origin & Usage

This metaphor likens a clear (明) mirror (镜) and still (止) water (水) to a state of perfect mental clarity. Rooted in Tang Dynasty Buddhist meditation texts, it describes the ideal state of mind - like a mirror's spotless surface or an undisturbed pond perfectly reflecting reality. The image resonated deeply with Chan Buddhist practitioners who sought to cultivate a mind free from distorting thoughts or emotions. In Confucian scholarly traditions, it became associated with the mental state required for proper judgment. The concept particularly influenced Chinese landscape painting, where artists sought to capture scenes with a mind as clear as still water. Modern usage extends to moments requiring absolute clarity, from critical decision-making to creative problem-solving, emphasizing the value of a calm, unbiased perspective.
