**Pronunciation:** *hǎi kū shí làn*  
**Literal meaning:** Seas dry, stones rot

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes seas (海) drying up (枯) and stones (石) rotting (烂). These are impossibilities that would take eternity - seas don't dry and stones don't rot. The phrase represents eternal commitment. Modern usage in romantic contexts expresses undying love, promises that will last until the impossible happens - essentially forever.

## Examples

**English:** "She promised to love him forever, no matter what happens."

**Chinese:** 她承诺无论发生什么，都会爱他到海枯石烂。
