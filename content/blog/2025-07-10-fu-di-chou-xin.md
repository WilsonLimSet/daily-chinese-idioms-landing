**Pronunciation:** *fǔ dǐ chōu xīn*  
**Literal meaning:** Remove firewood under pot

## Origin & Usage

This practical idiom describes removing (抽) firewood (薪) from under (底) a cooking pot (釜), originating from Wei-Jin period practical wisdom. Unlike dramatic interventions, it emphasized solving problems by eliminating their underlying causes. The cooking metaphor resonated deeply in Chinese culture, where food preparation metaphors often described governance and problem-solving. During the Tang Dynasty, it gained prominence in military texts advocating resource denial strategies over direct confrontation. Modern usage spans from political approaches to personal problem-solving, emphasizing how addressing fundamental enabling factors often proves more effective than combating surface manifestations. Unlike reactive approaches, it suggests proactive elimination of root causes.

## Examples

**English:** "The new policy addressed the root causes rather than just treating symptoms"

**Chinese:** 新政策解决了根本原因，而不仅仅是治标不治本
