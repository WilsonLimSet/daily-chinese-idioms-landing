**Pronunciation:** *mò mò wú wén*  
**Literal meaning:** Silently without fame

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes working silently (默默) without (无) anyone hearing of it (闻). It depicts humble labor without recognition or fame. The phrase can describe either a temporary state before recognition arrives or a permanent condition of unsung contribution. Chinese culture particularly values those who contribute without seeking acclaim. Modern usage often describes dedicated workers, artists, or contributors who labor in obscurity, sometimes admiringly and sometimes with hope for eventual recognition.

## Examples

**English:** "For years he worked anonymously before finally gaining recognition."

**Chinese:** 多年来他默默无闻地工作，最终获得认可。
