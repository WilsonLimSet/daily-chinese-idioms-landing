**Pronunciation:** *tiān wài yǒu tiān*  
**Literal meaning:** Skies beyond skies

## Origin & Usage

This idiom is intimately paired with '人外有人', together expressing that beyond (外) the sky (天) there is another sky, and beyond every person's abilities, there exists someone more capable. This dual meaning emerged from Daoist cosmological texts describing multiple heavens, but gained widespread use during the Song Dynasty through Buddhist scholarly exchanges. Both phrases serve as reminders of limitless potential and the importance of humility. The metaphor particularly resonated with Neo-Confucian scholars who saw it as a perfect expression of intellectual modesty. Modern usage often appears in professional or academic contexts to remind accomplished individuals that there are always greater heights to reach, especially when encountering unexpected excellence that transcends assumed limitations.

## Examples

**English:** "The champion was talented, but he knew there were even better players out there"

**Chinese:** 这位冠军很有天赋，但他知道还有更厉害的选手
