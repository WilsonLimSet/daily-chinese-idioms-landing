**Pronunciation:** *míng zhī gù fàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Clearly know yet deliberately violate

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes clearly knowing (明知) something is wrong yet deliberately (故) doing it anyway (犯). The phrase emphasizes the moral culpability that comes from conscious choice rather than ignorance. It appears in legal and ethical texts from the Tang Dynasty distinguishing intentional violations from innocent mistakes. The aggravating factor of awareness makes such transgressions more serious than errors from ignorance. Modern usage describes willful disregard of rules, advice, or moral standards when the person clearly knows better.

## Examples

**English:** "He knowingly broke the rules despite understanding the consequences."

**Chinese:** 尽管知道后果，他还是明知故犯。
