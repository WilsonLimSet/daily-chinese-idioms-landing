## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes change (变) from the original (本) state by adding (加) severity (厉). It depicts situations that worsen instead of improving, with problems intensifying rather than resolving. The phrase appeared in historical texts describing officials whose corruption deepened over time. It captures the frustration when intervention fails and conditions deteriorate. Modern usage describes any situation, behavior, or problem that escalates rather than ameliorates despite awareness or attempts at correction.
