## Origin & Usage

A fascinating example of cross-cultural linguistic exchange, emerged during China's period of modernization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a direct translation of the English phrase 'killing two birds with one stone.' While sharing similar words - one (一) stone (石) two (二) birds (鸟) - it represents a broader pattern of Western concept adoption during this era of increasing global contact. The traditional Chinese equivalent, '一箭双雕' (one arrow, two eagles), better reflects indigenous hunting imagery. Despite its foreign origins, the idiom has been fully embraced in modern Chinese, frequently appearing in business, academic, and everyday contexts to describe efficient solutions that solve multiple problems simultaneously. It serves as a linguistic reminder of how Chinese language and culture have dynamically integrated foreign influences while maintaining their own rich idiomatic traditions.
