**Pronunciation:** *méi kāi yǎn xiào*

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes brows (眉) opening (开) and eyes (眼) smiling (笑). It depicts the full facial expression of genuine happiness where both brows relax upward and eyes crinkle with joy. The phrase captures authentic emotion visible across the entire face. Modern usage describes obvious happiness, the kind of joy that involves the whole face and cannot be faked.
