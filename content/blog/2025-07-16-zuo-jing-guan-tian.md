**Pronunciation:** *zuò jǐng guān tiān*  
**Literal meaning:** Sit in well view sky

## Origin & Usage

This limiting idiom describes sitting (坐) in a well (井) while attempting to view (观) the sky (天), originating from philosophical debates during the Warring States period. It first appeared in texts critiquing narrow viewpoints resulting from limited experience. The well imagery created a powerful metaphor for how restricted perspective distorts understanding - from the bottom of a well, the sky appears as merely a small circle. During the Han Dynasty, it became associated with cautionary tales about scholars who refused to consider viewpoints outside their tradition. Modern usage criticizes narrow-mindedness resulting from limited exposure or experience, emphasizing how environmental constraints shape perception and judgment, particularly in cross-cultural or interdisciplinary contexts.

## Examples

**English:** "Having never traveled abroad, his perspective on international relations was severely limited"

**Chinese:** 由于从未出国旅行，他对国际关系的看法非常有限
