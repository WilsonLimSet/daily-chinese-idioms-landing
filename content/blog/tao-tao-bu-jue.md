**Pronunciation:** *tāo tāo bù jué*  
**Literal meaning:** Surging waves never ceasing

## Origin & Usage

This idiom uses the image of surging (滔滔) waves that never (不) cease (绝) to describe continuous, flowing speech. The reduplicated 'taotao' evokes the sound and rhythm of rushing water. The phrase appeared in classical texts describing eloquent orators whose words flowed like rivers. While it can praise eloquence, it often carries connotations of excessive talkativeness or inability to stop speaking. Modern usage describes someone who talks at length, either admiringly for skilled speakers or critically for those who dominate conversations.

## Examples

**English:** "Once he started talking about his hobby, he went on endlessly."

**Chinese:** 一旦开始谈论他的爱好，他就滔滔不绝。
