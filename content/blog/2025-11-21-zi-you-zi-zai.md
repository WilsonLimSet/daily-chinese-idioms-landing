## Origin & Usage

Zhuangzi's philosophical writings in the 4th century BCE introduced this concept of complete freedom combining self-determination (自由) with unrestricted existence (自在). Tang Dynasty poets expanded it beyond spiritual contexts to describe ideal lifestyle autonomy. The doubled 'self' characters emphasize that true freedom emerges from internal state rather than external circumstances. Modern usage celebrates the rare combination of external liberty and internal psychological liberation.
