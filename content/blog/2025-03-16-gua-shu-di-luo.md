**Pronunciation:** *guā shú dì luò*  
**Literal meaning:** Melon ripe stem falls

## Origin & Usage

This agricultural metaphor describes how a melon (瓜) naturally falls from its stem (蒂) when ripe (熟), originating from peasant wisdom during the Spring and Autumn period. Farmers observed that forcing a melon from the vine before its time yielded poor results, while patience produced perfectly ripened fruit that separated naturally. The idiom gained prominence in Confucian texts discussing the importance of proper timing in governance and personal development. In modern contexts, it's often used in business and career discussions to emphasize how opportunities and achievements manifest organically when conditions are right, cautioning against rushing natural processes or forcing outcomes before their time.

## Examples

**English:** "The project succeeded because they waited for the right moment"

**Chinese:** 项目成功是因为他们等待了适当的时机
