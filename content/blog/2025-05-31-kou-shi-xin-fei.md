**Pronunciation:** *kǒu shì xīn fēi*  
**Literal meaning:** Mouth yes heart no

## Origin & Usage

Originating in Tang Dynasty Buddhist texts discussing the alignment of speech and thought, this idiom describes when the mouth (口) says yes (是) but the heart (心) means no (非). It became a key concept in Song Dynasty moral philosophy, where scholars debated the ethics of social courtesy versus absolute honesty. Historical accounts tell of officials using this phrase to criticize colleagues who publicly supported policies they privately opposed. Modern usage often describes social situations where politeness and true feelings conflict, highlighting the universal tension between social harmony and personal authenticity.

## Examples

**English:** "The politician's public support contradicted his private actions"

**Chinese:** 这位政治家的公开支持与他的私下行为相矛盾
