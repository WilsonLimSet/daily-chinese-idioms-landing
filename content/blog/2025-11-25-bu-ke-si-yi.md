**Pronunciation:** *bù kě sī yì*
**Literal meaning:** Cannot be thought discussed

## Origin & Usage

Early Buddhist sutras translated during the Eastern Han Dynasty brought us this description of matters that cannot (不可) be comprehended through thought or discussion (思议). Originally describing transcendent Buddha-realms beyond ordinary understanding, Tang Dynasty writers adopted it for any phenomena defying rational explanation. Today it perfectly captures moments when human comprehension meets its fundamental limits, from quantum physics to artistic genius.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The quantum phenomenon defied all conventional understanding of physics
