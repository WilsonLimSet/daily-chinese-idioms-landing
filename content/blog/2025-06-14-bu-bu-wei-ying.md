**Pronunciation:** *bù bù wéi yíng*  
**Literal meaning:** Each step make camp

## Origin & Usage

This strategic approach emerged from Han Dynasty military manuals, describing armies that established (为) a secure camp (营) with each step (步步) of their advance. The tactic gained fame during the Three Kingdoms period when general Cao Cao used it to campaign through difficult terrain. Unlike rapid deployment, it emphasized consolidation of gains before further advancement. Historical texts praise commanders who secured supply lines and fortified positions rather than overextending. During the Ming Dynasty, it became shorthand for prudent administration in frontier governance. Modern applications span from business expansion strategies to personal career advancement, advocating methodical progress where each position becomes a foundation for the next.

## Examples

**English:** "The company expanded cautiously, securing each market before moving to the next"

**Chinese:** 公司谨慎扩张，在进军下一个市场前先稳固每一个市场
