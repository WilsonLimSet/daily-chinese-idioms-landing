**Pronunciation:** *sān xǐng wú shēn*  
**Literal meaning:** Examine self three times

## Origin & Usage

Drawing from Confucius's Analects, this practice of examining (省) oneself (吾身) three (三) times daily reflects core Confucian principles of constant self-improvement. The specific number three references examining one's loyalty in serving others, trustworthiness with friends, and mastery of transmitted wisdom. During the Song Dynasty, it became a fundamental practice in Neo-Confucian self-cultivation. The concept was further developed in Ming Dynasty academies, where students maintained detailed journals of their daily self-examinations. In the Qing Dynasty, it influenced government officials' practice of maintaining self-reflection diaries. Modern usage emphasizes regular self-reflection and ethical examination, particularly in professional development and personal growth contexts, though often without the literal adherence to three daily reviews.

## Examples
