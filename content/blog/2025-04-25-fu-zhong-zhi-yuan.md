**Pronunciation:** *fù zhòng zhì yuǎn*  
**Literal meaning:** Bear weight reach far

## Origin & Usage

Emerging from Confucian teachings about personal development, this idiom combines bearing (负) weight (重) with reaching (致) far (远) distances. The image comes from classical texts describing how young scholars would intentionally carry heavy loads while studying, building both physical and mental endurance. During the Song Dynasty, it became associated with the ideal of comprehensive self-cultivation, where hardship was seen as essential to achieving distant goals. Modern applications emphasize the value of embracing challenges for long-term success, particularly in education, career development, and personal growth. It teaches that meaningful achievements require willingness to shoulder heavy responsibilities.

## Examples
