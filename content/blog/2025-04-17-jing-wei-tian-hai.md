**Pronunciation:** *jīng wèi tián hǎi*  
**Literal meaning:** Bird fills sea with pebbles

## Origin & Usage

This poignant idiom comes from an ancient myth about Nüwa's daughter, who drowned in the Eastern Sea and became a bird (精卫) determined to fill (填) the sea (海) with pebbles. The story first appeared in the Classic of Mountains and Seas, symbolizing unwavering determination against overwhelming odds. The bird's relentless effort, carrying twigs and pebbles one by one, resonated through Chinese literature as a metaphor for indomitable spirit. During the Han Dynasty, the story gained political significance, often cited by officials undertaking seemingly impossible reforms. The Tang Dynasty saw it frequently referenced in poetry about perseverance against fate. Modern usage celebrates persistent effort in face of seemingly impossible goals, particularly in environmental protection and social justice movements, where small individual actions accumulate toward massive change.
