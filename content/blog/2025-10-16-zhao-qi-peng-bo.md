## Origin & Usage

Early Daoist texts first connected morning energy (朝气) with vigorously flourishing spirit (蓬勃), seeing dawn as the embodiment of vital force. Tang Dynasty poets expanded this imagery to celebrate youthful vigor in all its forms. The agricultural society of ancient China gave special meaning to morning as a time of optimal energy and symbolic renewal. Modern usage captures that special quality of enthusiasm found in new beginnings, from startup companies to fresh initiatives.
