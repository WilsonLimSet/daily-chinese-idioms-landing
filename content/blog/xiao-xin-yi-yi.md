## Origin & Usage

From the ancient verses of the 'Book of Songs' (1000-600 BCE) comes this image of approaching tasks with a cautious heart (小心) and bird-like alertness (翼翼). Court officials first used it to describe navigating treacherous political environments. Han Dynasty writers expanded its use to describe handling anything precious or fragile. The avian metaphor perfectly captured the combination of focused attention and readiness to retreat from danger. Modern conservators and diplomats still embody this careful approach where one wrong move could cause irreparable damage.
