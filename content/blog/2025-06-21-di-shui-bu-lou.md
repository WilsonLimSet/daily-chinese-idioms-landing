**Pronunciation:** *dī shuǐ bù lòu*  
**Literal meaning:** No water drop leaks

## Origin & Usage

This meticulous idiom describes arrangements so perfect that not even a drop (滴) of water (水) can leak through (不漏), originating from Song Dynasty architectural standards for imperial roofing. Court builders used it to describe the ideal construction quality for palace structures, where even the smallest leak could damage precious interiors. The phrase gained broader usage during the Ming Dynasty in legal contexts, describing airtight arguments or documentation. The water metaphor was particularly meaningful in a culture where brush-written documents could be ruined by even minor moisture. Modern usage describes flawless execution in any context requiring absolute precision, from legal contracts to security systems.

## Examples

**English:** "The contract was written with precise language that left no room for misinterpretation"

**Chinese:** 合同用精确的语言撰写，滴水不漏
