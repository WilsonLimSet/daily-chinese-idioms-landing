**Pronunciation:** *qǔ cháng bǔ duǎn*  
**Literal meaning:** Take strengths fix weaknesses

## Origin & Usage

This balanced approach advocates taking (取) strengths (长) to supplement (补) weaknesses (短), first appearing in Han Dynasty governance texts. The concept gained practical application during the Tang Dynasty's civil service reforms, where officials were paired to complement each other's abilities. Historical records show how Emperor Taizong deliberately combined ministers with different talents to strengthen his administration. The principle influenced Chinese military strategy, where generals were taught to leverage their armies' strengths against enemy weaknesses. Modern applications span from business partnerships to education, emphasizing how complementary collaboration often achieves what individual effort cannot. Unlike simple copying, it suggests thoughtful integration of diverse strengths to create balanced systems.

## Examples

**English:** "The international team combined German engineering with Italian design"

**Chinese:** 这个国际团队结合了德国工程和意大利设计
