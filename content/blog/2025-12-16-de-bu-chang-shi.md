**Pronunciation:** *dé bù cháng shī*
**Literal meaning:** Gain not compensate loss

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty agricultural texts first warned of gains (得) that don't compensate (不偿) for losses (失) when discussing soil depletion from over-farming. Tang Dynasty philosophers expanded it into a broader principle of cost-benefit analysis. The accounting metaphor proves particularly relevant today in evaluating everything from personal choices to policy decisions.

## When to Use
