**Pronunciation:** *qī shàng bā xià*  
**Literal meaning:** Seven up eight down

## Origin & Usage

This numerical idiom uses seven (七) up (上) and eight (八) down (下) to describe a state of anxious confusion, originating from Song Dynasty vernacular expressions. The numbers themselves carry no specific meaning beyond creating rhythmic opposition to represent mental turmoil. The phrase gained prominence through Yuan Dynasty dramatic works, where characters experiencing emotional distress would describe their hearts as going 'seven up eight down.' Unlike terms for simple nervousness, it specifically describes disorganized thinking from anxiety. Modern usage denotes the physical and mental experience of anxious anticipation, particularly before significant events with uncertain outcomes, capturing both the cognitive disarray and physical discomfort of such states.

## Examples

**English:** "The candidate felt extremely anxious while waiting for the interview results"

**Chinese:** 候选人在等待面试结果时感到忐忑不安
