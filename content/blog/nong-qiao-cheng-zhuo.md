**Pronunciation:** *nòng qiǎo chéng zhuō*  
**Literal meaning:** Playing clever becomes clumsy

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes how attempting (弄) to be clever (巧) results (成) in clumsiness (拙). It captures the irony of sophisticated plans that backfire, producing worse outcomes than simple approaches would have. The phrase appeared in Song Dynasty texts criticizing officials whose intricate schemes created problems. It warns against overcomplication and excessive cleverness. Modern usage describes situations where attempts to be smart or sophisticated produce counterproductive results, often through trying too hard or overthinking.

## Examples

**English:** "His elaborate excuse backfired and made things worse."

**Chinese:** 他精心编造的借口弄巧成拙，让事情变得更糟。
