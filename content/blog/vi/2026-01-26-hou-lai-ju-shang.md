**Pronunciation:** *hòu lái jū shàng*
**Literal meaning:** Latecomers end up on top

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from 'Records of the Grand Historian' (史记), describing how later (后来) officials often rose (居上) to higher positions than their predecessors. The phrase was used by Emperor Wu of Han's advisor to explain why recently appointed ministers sometimes outranked senior ones. It suggests that timing of entry does not determine ultimate success. Modern usage celebrates underdogs and late starters who surpass early leaders through superior effort or strategy, particularly relevant in competitive markets and sports.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The startup that entered the market last became the industry leader.
