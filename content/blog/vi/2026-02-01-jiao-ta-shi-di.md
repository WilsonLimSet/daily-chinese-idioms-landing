## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated during the Song Dynasty in biographical accounts praising scholars who pursued knowledge through steady, practical effort rather than seeking shortcuts. The image of feet (脚) firmly stepping (踏) on solid (实) ground (地) contrasts with those who have their heads in the clouds. The phrase embodies the Confucian value of earnest effort and realistic approach to achievement. It remains particularly popular in educational and professional contexts, encouraging steady work over flashy but insubstantial approaches.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Success comes from practical, grounded efforts rather than empty dreams.
