**Pronunciation:** *dēng fēng zào jí*  
**Literal meaning:** Climb peak reach limit

## Origin & Usage

This expression describes climbing (登) to the mountain peak (峰) and reaching (造) the ultimate limit (极), originating from Daoist geographical texts of the Han Dynasty. It first described pilgrimages to sacred mountains believed to connect heaven and earth. During the Tang Dynasty, it evolved beyond literal mountain climbing to represent the pursuit of perfection in any discipline. The imagery draws from China's five sacred mountains, whose summits were considered the highest achievements for both religious devotees and travelers. Contemporary usage celebrates those who have mastered their fields to the highest possible degree, suggesting both the difficulty of the journey and the rarified atmosphere of ultimate achievement.

## Examples
