**Pronunciation:** *wàng yáng xìng tàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Gaze at ocean sigh deeply

## Origin & Usage

This idiom captures the feeling of gazing (望) at the vast ocean (洋) and responding with deep sighs (兴叹) of awe or resignation. It originated from the Qin Dynasty, reportedly from Jing Ke's reaction upon seeing the eastern sea before his assassination attempt on the future First Emperor. The phrase gained literary prominence during the Tang Dynasty as poets used it to describe confronting overwhelming natural grandeur. The ocean metaphor was particularly meaningful in Chinese cosmology, representing both opportunity and insurmountable vastness. Modern usage describes feeling overwhelmed by challenges that seem beyond one's capabilities, though it maintains subtle appreciation for the magnitude that inspires such feelings.
