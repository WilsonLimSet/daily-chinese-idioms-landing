**Pronunciation:** *yìng jiē bù xiá*  
**Literal meaning:** Responding and receiving without leisure

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes being so busy responding (应) and receiving (接) that there is no (不) leisure (暇). It originates from texts describing the overwhelming beauty of scenery that the eyes cannot fully take in. The phrase evolved to describe any situation with too much to handle. Modern usage commonly describes being overwhelmed by work, visitors, or demands, suggesting a positive problem (abundance) that nevertheless exceeds capacity to manage.

## Examples

**English:** "The sudden influx of customers left the staff overwhelmed."

**Chinese:** 突然涌入的顾客让员工应接不暇。
