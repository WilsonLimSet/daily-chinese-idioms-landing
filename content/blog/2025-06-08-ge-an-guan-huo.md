**Pronunciation:** *gé àn guān huǒ*  
**Literal meaning:** Watch fire from opposite shore

## Origin & Usage

This evocative idiom describes watching (观) a fire (火) from the opposite (隔) shore (岸), originating from Tang Dynasty accounts of riverside village fires. Historical records tell how those safely across the river could observe disasters without personal risk. The phrase gained moral dimensions during the Song Dynasty when Neo-Confucian scholars used it to criticize those who remained detached from community problems. The image draws power from ancient Chinese riverside settlements, where water created both protection and division. Modern usage often carries negative connotations, describing cynical detachment or strategic non-intervention in others' difficulties, particularly in business competition or international relations.

## Examples

**English:** "The competing company observed their rival's crisis without offering assistance"
