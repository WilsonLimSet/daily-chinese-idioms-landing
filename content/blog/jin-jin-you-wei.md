## Origin & Usage

This idiom uses the reduplicated 'jinjin' (津津), meaning moist or flowing with saliva, combined with 'having flavor' (有味) to describe intense enjoyment. The salivation metaphor connects to the physical response of anticipating delicious food. First appearing in Ming Dynasty literature, the phrase described both literal enjoyment of food and metaphorical relish for any engaging experience. Modern usage emphasizes enthusiastic engagement, whether reading a book, listening to a story, or pursuing any absorbing activity.
