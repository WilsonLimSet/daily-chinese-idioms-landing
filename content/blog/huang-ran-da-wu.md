**Pronunciation:** *huǎng rán dà wù*
**Literal meaning:** Suddenly great awakening

## Origin & Usage

Buddhist meditation traditions gave us this description of sudden clarity (恍然) leading to great awakening (大悟). Unlike gradual enlightenment, this represented those electric moments of instant comprehension. Tang Dynasty writers adopted it for any profound realization after confusion. Today it captures those 'eureka' moments when previously incomprehensible patterns suddenly snap into perfect clarity.

## When to Use
