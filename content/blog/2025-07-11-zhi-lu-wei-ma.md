**Pronunciation:** *zhǐ lù wéi mǎ*  
**Literal meaning:** Point deer call horse

## Origin & Usage

This idiom references the historical incident where someone pointed at (指) a deer (鹿) and called it (为) a horse (马), originating from the Qin Dynasty. Historical records recount how powerful minister Zhao Gao tested his influence by leading a deer into court and calling it a horse, executing officials who contradicted him. The incident demonstrated how power could distort reality through enforced consensus. During the Han Dynasty, historians used it to describe the dangerous period of ministerial overreach after the First Emperor's death. Unlike terms for simple deception, it specifically describes deliberately misrepresenting reality as a display of power, forcing others to accept obvious falsehoods. Modern usage describes situations where institutional power compels acknowledgment of manifest untruths.

## Examples

**English:** "The corrupt official deliberately misrepresented facts to protect his allies"

**Chinese:** 腐败官员故意歪曲事实以保护他的盟友
