**Pronunciation:** *jiāng láng cái jìn*  
**Literal meaning:** Jiang Yan's talent exhausted

## Origin & Usage

This creative depletion idiom references poet Jiang Yan's (江郎) talent becoming exhausted (才尽), originating from Southern Dynasty literary criticism. According to historical accounts, Jiang produced brilliant early work but later compositions showed marked decline in quality. Literary historians used this case to discuss whether creative abilities could diminish over time. During the Tang Dynasty, as literacy expanded, it became a standard reference in discussions about artistic longevity. Unlike terms for temporary blocks, it specifically describes permanent diminishment of once-demonstrated abilities. Modern usage describes the decline of creative or intellectual capabilities, particularly when comparing an individual's earlier and later works, suggesting that even remarkable talent can sometimes exhaust itself.

## Examples

**English:** "The once-brilliant writer seemed to have lost his creative abilities"

**Chinese:** 这位曾经才华横溢的作家似乎已经失去了创作能力
