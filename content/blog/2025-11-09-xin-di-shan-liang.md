## Origin & Usage

This phrase originated from Buddhist terminology during the Eastern Han Dynasty introduction of Buddhism to China. It appeared in early sutras translated into Chinese describing ideal character cultivation. During the Tang Dynasty, it transitioned from purely religious contexts to general ethical description. The metaphor of a heart and inner ground (心地) that is kind and virtuous (善良) was particularly effective—fertile ground nurtures wholesome growth just as good character foundation produces virtuous actions. Unlike terms simply meaning 'nice,' it specifically addresses innate moral character quality rather than merely pleasant behavior. Modern usage spans personal recommendation to relationship assessment, describing fundamental character disposition rather than situational behavior, particularly valuing genuine kindness arising from authentic internal orientation rather than superficial courtesy for social advantage.

## When to Use
