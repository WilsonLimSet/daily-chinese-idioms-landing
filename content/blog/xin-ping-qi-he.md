## Origin & Usage

This idiom combines 'calm heart' (心平) with 'harmonious breath/energy' (气和), reflecting traditional Chinese understanding of emotional and physical balance. In Chinese medicine and philosophy, the state of one's 'qi' (气) directly affects emotional disposition. The phrase appears in Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian texts promoting emotional equilibrium as essential for moral cultivation. It represents the ideal state for rational discourse and decision-making. Modern usage encourages composed, level-headed communication, especially in potentially contentious situations.
