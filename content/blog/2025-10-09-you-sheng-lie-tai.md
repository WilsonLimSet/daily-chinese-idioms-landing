**Pronunciation:** *yōu shèng liè tài*
**Literal meaning:** Superior wins inferior eliminated

## Origin & Usage

This evolutionary idiom describes how the superior (优) survives (胜) while the inferior (劣) is eliminated (汰), entering Chinese discourse during the late Qing Dynasty through translations of Herbert Spencer's social Darwinism. It gained prominence during early Republican-era modernization movements as reformers applied natural selection concepts to social development. The biological metaphor resonated deeply during China's confrontation with industrial powers, offering an explanatory framework for international competition. Modern usage spans business competition to technological evolution, describing how environmental pressures naturally select superior adaptations.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The competitive market naturally forced inefficient companies into bankruptcy
