**Pronunciation:** *shì ér bù jiàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Look but not see

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes looking (视) but not (不) seeing (见), indicating willful blindness rather than genuine inability to perceive. The phrase originated in Daoist philosophy discussing how distracted minds fail to register what's before them. It evolved to describe deliberate ignorance or choosing not to acknowledge obvious realities. Modern usage commonly criticizes those who intentionally overlook problems, injustice, or inconvenient truths that they would prefer to ignore.

## Examples

**English:** "Management deliberately ignored the obvious problems."

**Chinese:** 管理层对明显的问题视而不见。
