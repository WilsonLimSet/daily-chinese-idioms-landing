**Pronunciation:** *zhǐ shàng tán bīng*  
**Literal meaning:** Discuss war on paper

## Origin & Usage

This critique emerged from the story of Zhao Kuo, a general who was well-versed in military texts but failed catastrophically in actual battle. His expertise in discussing (谈) warfare (兵) remained purely on paper (纸上). The idiom appears in historical texts describing the Battle of Changping (260 BCE), where Zhao Kuo's theoretical knowledge proved useless against practical experience. The devastating defeat of 400,000 Zhao soldiers became a lasting lesson in the limitations of pure book learning. Modern usage extends beyond military contexts to criticize those who have theoretical knowledge but lack practical experience, particularly relevant in professional training and education reform.

## Examples

**English:** "The consultant's theories proved useless when faced with real business challenges"

**Chinese:** 顾问的理论在面对实际商业挑战时证明毫无用处
