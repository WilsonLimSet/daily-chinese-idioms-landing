**Pronunciation:** *fēi é pū huǒ*
**Literal meaning:** Flying moth rushes fire

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty naturalists first documented this self-destructive phenomenon of moths (飞蛾) rushing toward flames (扑火). Tang Dynasty poets transformed this natural observation into a powerful metaphor for human self-destructive fascinations. The biological accuracy makes it particularly compelling - moths genuinely exhibit this behavior, creating a perfect natural metaphor for irrational attraction to harmful things.
