**Pronunciation:** *fēng yǔ wú zǔ*  
**Literal meaning:** Wind rain no hindrance

## Origin & Usage

This determined idiom states that wind (风) and rain (雨) present no (无) obstacle (阻), originating from Han Dynasty courier service standards. Historical records describe how imperial postal systems maintained operation regardless of weather conditions, ensuring communication across the vast empire. During the Tang Dynasty, the phrase appeared in military manuals describing ideal troop resilience. The specific mention of wind and rain represented the most common natural challenges rather than extraordinary disasters. Unlike terms for blind recklessness, it emphasizes determined persistence despite normal difficulties. Modern usage describes steadfast dedication to duty or purpose regardless of predictable challenges, particularly in service contexts where reliability despite conditions is valued.

## Examples

**English:** "The delivery service continued operating throughout the severe typhoon season"
