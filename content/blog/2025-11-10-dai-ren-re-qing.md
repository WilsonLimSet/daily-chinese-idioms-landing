**Pronunciation:** *dài rén rè qíng*
**Literal meaning:** Treat people warmly

## Origin & Usage

This phrase originated from Song Dynasty etiquette manuals for merchant households, first providing guidance for commercial hospitality before broadening to general interpersonal warmth. During the Ming Dynasty, it entered assessments of social cultivation and character. The concept of treating others (待人) with enthusiasm and warmth (热情) used a temperature metaphor that was particularly apt—warmth naturally draws people closer while coldness creates distance. Unlike terms simply meaning 'friendly,' it specifically emphasizes active, energetic goodwill rather than merely amiable disposition. Modern usage spans hospitality contexts to personal recommendations, describing the particular social skill of making others feel genuinely welcomed through demonstrated interest and energy, particularly valuing the ability to create immediate comfort and connection across status differences or with strangers.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The small-town shopkeeper greeted every customer like an old friend
