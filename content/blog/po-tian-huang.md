**Pronunciation:** *pò tiān huāng*  
**Literal meaning:** Breaking heaven's wasteland

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes breaking (破) through heaven's (天) wasteland (荒). It originates from Tang Dynasty examination history when the Jingzhou region, long considered intellectually barren, finally produced a successful examination candidate, 'breaking' its record of failure. The phrase marks unprecedented first achievements. Modern usage describes doing something for the very first time, particularly achievements that break established patterns or expectations.
