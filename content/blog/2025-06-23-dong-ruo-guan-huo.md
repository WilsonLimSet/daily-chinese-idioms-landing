**Pronunciation:** *dòng ruò guān huǒ*  
**Literal meaning:** Clear as watching fire

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes understanding something as clearly (洞) as (若) watching (观) fire (火), originating from the Warring States period. It first appeared in Daoist texts describing the mental clarity achieved through meditation, where complex truths became as obvious as flames in darkness. The fire metaphor was particularly meaningful in pre-electric societies, where fire represented the ultimate clarity-bringing element. During the Tang Dynasty, it became associated with moments of sudden enlightenment in Buddhist practice. Unlike terms for gradual comprehension, it suggests immediate, complete understanding. Modern usage describes moments of breakthrough clarity, particularly in scientific discovery or problem-solving, when confusing situations suddenly become perfectly comprehensible.

## Examples

**English:** "The detective's analysis made the complex case suddenly comprehensible"

**Chinese:** 侦探的分析使复杂的案件突然变得清晰明了
