**Pronunciation:** *xíng yǐng bù lí*  
**Literal meaning:** Body and shadow never separate

## Origin & Usage

This idiom compares close companions to a person (形, form/body) and their shadow (影) that never (不) separate (离). The phrase originates from ancient Chinese poetry expressing the pain of loneliness, where one had only their shadow for company. It evolved to describe the most intimate of relationships where two people are constantly together. The physical impossibility of separating from one's shadow emphasizes the strength of the bond. Modern usage describes best friends, devoted couples, or any inseparable pair.

## Examples

**English:** "The two friends are inseparable, always seen together."

**Chinese:** 这两个朋友形影不离，总是在一起。
