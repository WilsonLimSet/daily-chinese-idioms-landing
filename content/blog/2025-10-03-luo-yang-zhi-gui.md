## {{originUsage}}

This idiom tells of how paper in Luoyang (洛阳) became expensive (纸贵) due to overwhelming demand for a single work. It originated from the Jin Dynasty, when Zuo Si's 'Biography of Lady Wei' became so popular that paper prices in the capital reportedly soared as everyone sought copies. The geographical reference was significant - Luoyang represented the height of cultural sophistication as an ancient capital. During the Tang period, it became the ultimate metaphor for literary success. Modern usage describes works or ideas generating exceptional public interest, particularly when intellectual contributions transition from elite appreciation to mainstream phenomenon.
