**Pronunciation:** *fēng yún jì huì*  
**Literal meaning:** Wind cloud gather meeting

## Origin & Usage

Drawing from ancient Chinese cosmology, this idiom describes the dramatic moment when wind (风) and clouds (云) gather (际会) before a momentous change. The imagery comes from astronomical observations recorded during the Zhou Dynasty, where such atmospheric phenomena were seen as heavenly omens. Historical texts use this phrase to describe pivotal moments before major historical changes. Modern usage applies to the convergence of favorable circumstances or the perfect timing of opportunities, particularly in business ventures or social movements, emphasizing both the drama and the ephemeral nature of such moments.

## Examples

**English:** "The market conditions created a perfect opportunity for the new venture"
