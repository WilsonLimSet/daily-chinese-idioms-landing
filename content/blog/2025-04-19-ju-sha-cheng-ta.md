**Pronunciation:** *jù shā chéng tǎ*  
**Literal meaning:** Gather sand make tower

## Origin & Usage

The concept of gathering (聚) sand (沙) to build (成) a tower (塔) emerged from Buddhist temple construction practices during the Northern Wei Dynasty. The image of accumulated individual grains forming a massive structure became a metaphor for collective effort and gradual progress. It gained particular relevance during the Song Dynasty's emphasis on incremental learning and self-cultivation. The metaphor was often paired with practical examples of large-scale public works projects, where countless small contributions led to monumental achievements. During the Ming Dynasty, it became associated with the compilation of massive encyclopedias through the contributions of numerous scholars. Contemporary usage often appears in discussions of crowd-funding, community projects, or personal savings, emphasizing how small, consistent actions can lead to significant achievements over time.
