**Pronunciation:** *shì wài táo yuán*  
**Literal meaning:** Peach spring beyond world

## Origin & Usage

This phrase describing a peach (桃) blossom spring (源) beyond (外) the world (世) comes from Tao Yuanming's famous 5th-century prose poem about a fisherman discovering an isolated utopia. The story of finding a hidden valley where people lived in perfect harmony, unaware of the empire's political turbulence, resonated deeply in Chinese culture. The idyllic community, accessed through a cave in a peach grove, became the archetypal symbol of escape from worldly troubles. During the Tang and Song dynasties, countless poets and painters reinterpreted this theme, creating a rich tradition of utopian imagery. Modern usage describes any peaceful retreat from society's pressures, whether physical or metaphorical, particularly in contexts where people seek authenticity and simplicity away from modern complications.

## Examples
