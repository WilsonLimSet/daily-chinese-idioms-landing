**Pronunciation:** *bēi gōng shé yǐng*  
**Literal meaning:** Bow in cup snake shadow

## Origin & Usage

This tale from the Jin Dynasty chronicles a scholar who saw a bow's (弓) reflection in his cup (杯), mistaking it for a snake (蛇) shadow (影). His subsequent illness from fear only subsided when he discovered the truth. First recorded in 'Jin Shu', the story resonated with Buddhist teachings about how perceptions shape reality. The idiom addresses how misunderstandings can create real consequences, even when based on illusory fears. In contemporary usage, it serves as a caution against letting unfounded anxieties or misperceptions affect decision-making, particularly relevant in business and social media contexts where appearances can be deceptive.

## Examples

**English:** "The team's excessive caution about minor changes paralyzed decision-making"

**Chinese:** 团队对小变化的过度警惕导致决策瘫痪
