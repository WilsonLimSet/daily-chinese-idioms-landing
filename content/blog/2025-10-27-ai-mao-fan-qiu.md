## Origin & Usage

The Warring States period text 'Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals' introduces this image of loving fur (爱毛) so much that one turns a fur coat inside out (反裘) to examine its foundation. Han Dynasty scholars transformed it into a metaphor for valuing origins over appearances. In northern China, where fur provided essential winter protection, the metaphor carried particular weight. Today it describes honoring foundations and origins, particularly in expressing gratitude toward those who provided essential knowledge enabling later success.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Despite his formal training, he respected the folk traditions of his hometown artisans
