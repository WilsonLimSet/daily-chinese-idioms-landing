**Pronunciation:** *wáng yáng bǔ láo*  
**Literal meaning:** Fix pen after lost sheep

## Origin & Usage

This practical wisdom originates from an ancient shepherd who, after losing (亡) sheep (羊), finally repaired (补) his pen (牢). The story, recorded in 'Guanzi', became a governance parable during the Warring States period. Officials used it to argue for preventive policies rather than reactive measures. The idiom gained additional significance during the Ming Dynasty when it was applied to national defense strategies. Modern usage spans from cybersecurity to relationship maintenance, emphasizing that while late corrections can't undo past losses, they can prevent future ones. It advocates for learning from mistakes and taking corrective action, however belated.

## Examples
