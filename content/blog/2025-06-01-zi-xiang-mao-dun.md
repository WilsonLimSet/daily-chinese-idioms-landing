**Pronunciation:** *zì xiāng máo dùn*  
**Literal meaning:** Spear shield contradict self

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from a famous logical paradox in the Han Feizi, where a merchant claimed to have a spear (矛) that could pierce anything and a shield (盾) that could block anything - creating a self (自) contradicting (相) claim. The story became a classic example in Chinese logical discourse, used to expose inconsistent arguments. During the Song Dynasty, it became a standard term in philosophical debates. Modern usage extends beyond logic to any self-defeating behavior or inherently inconsistent policy, from corporate strategies to personal life choices.

## Examples

**English:** "The policy's conflicting requirements made implementation impossible"

**Chinese:** 政策中相互矛盾的要求使得实施变得不可能
