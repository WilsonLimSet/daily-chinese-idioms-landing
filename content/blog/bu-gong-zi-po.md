## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes something collapsing (破) by itself (自) without (不) attack (攻). Originally a military term for fortifications so weak they crumble without assault, it evolved to describe arguments or positions that are inherently unsustainable. The phrase appeared in strategy texts discussing situations where patience defeats opponents naturally. Modern usage describes weak arguments, flawed plans, or unstable situations that fail without external intervention.

## Examples

**English:** "His flimsy argument fell apart without anyone even challenging it."

**Chinese:** 他站不住脚的论点不攻自破。
