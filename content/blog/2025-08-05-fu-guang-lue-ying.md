**Pronunciation:** *fú guāng lüè yǐng*  
**Literal meaning:** Floating light fleeting shadow

## Origin & Usage

This ephemeral idiom combines floating (浮) light (光) with fleeting (掠) shadows (影), originating from Southern Dynasty poetry. It first appeared in verses describing the transient nature of reflections on water, creating a powerful metaphor for superficial experiences without depth. The imagery drew from traditional Chinese landscape aesthetics, where reflections and shadows represented impermanence. During the Tang Dynasty, Buddhist philosophers adopted it to illustrate the illusory nature of sensory experience. Unlike terms for simple carelessness, it emphasizes the inherently superficial nature of certain perceptions. Modern usage describes cursory understanding or brief impressions that lack substantive engagement, particularly in contexts of cultural appreciation or knowledge acquisition.

## Examples

**English:** "The one-day tour only gave tourists a superficial impression of the ancient culture"

**Chinese:** 一日游只能给游客留下古老文化的肤浅印象
