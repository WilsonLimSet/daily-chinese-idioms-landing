**Pronunciation:** *yǐ hé wéi guì*  
**Literal meaning:** Value harmony as precious

## Origin & Usage

This idiom, promoting harmony (和) as precious (贵), traces back to the Zhou Dynasty classic 'Guoyu,' reflecting early Chinese diplomatic philosophy. The concept gained renewed importance during the Tang Dynasty's cosmopolitan empire, where it guided both domestic governance and international relations. The phrase suggests that harmony is more valuable than victory in confrontation, advocating for balanced solutions over dominant ones. During the Song Dynasty, Neo-Confucian philosophers expanded its meaning to include personal relationships and social order. Modern usage promotes conflict resolution through compromise and mutual understanding, particularly valuable in business negotiations and international relations.

## Examples

**English:** "Instead of arguing, they found a compromise that benefited everyone"
