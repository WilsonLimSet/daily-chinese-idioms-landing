**Pronunciation:** *yè láng zì dà*  
**Literal meaning:** Small kingdom thinks itself great

## Origin & Usage

This idiom references the ancient kingdom of Yelang (夜郎), whose ruler allegedly believed his small state rivaled the Han Empire in greatness (自大). The story first appeared in official Han histories, recording how a Yelang king asked a Han envoy if his kingdom was larger than Han - displaying remarkable provincial ignorance. During the Tang and Song dynasties, the phrase became a standard critique of inflated self-importance based on limited perspective. Modern usage describes any situation where someone overestimates their importance due to inexperience or isolation. It serves as a reminder that true self-assessment requires broader perspective and knowledge of the larger world.

## Examples

**English:** "Having never left his small town, he thought his local success made him world-class"

**Chinese:** 从未离开过小城镇的他，以为本地的成功就意味着世界级水平
