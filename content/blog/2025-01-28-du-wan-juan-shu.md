**Pronunciation:** *dú wàn juǎn shū*  
**Literal meaning:** Read ten thousand scrolls

## Origin & Usage

Originating from a longer saying by the Tang Dynasty scholar Du Fu: '读万卷书，行万里路' (Read ten thousand scrolls, walk ten thousand li). The specific number wasn't meant literally - 'ten thousand' in Classical Chinese often represented an exhaustive quantity. The scroll measurement was significant, as classical texts were stored on bamboo or silk scrolls, each requiring careful unrolling and dedicated study. During the Song Dynasty, it became a cornerstone of scholarly preparation for the imperial examinations. Modern usage emphasizes the value of broad, deep reading in an age of superficial digital consumption. It suggests that true wisdom comes not just from reading many books, but from lived experience aswell - an especially relevant message in today's world where digital learning often substitutes for real-world experience.
