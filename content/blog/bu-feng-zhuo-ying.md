**Pronunciation:** *bǔ fēng zhuō yǐng*
**Literal meaning:** Catch wind grasp shadow

## Origin & Usage

Tang Dynasty Buddhist texts warn of the futility of trying to catch wind (捕风) and grasp shadows (捉影). Song Dynasty philosophers transformed this spiritual metaphor into a powerful critique of baseless accusations and insubstantial evidence. Ming Dynasty legal scholars particularly favored it when condemning prosecutions built on shadows rather than substance. The physical impossibility of the task - attempting to capture things that exist but resist physical grasp - perfectly describes pursuits based on evidence too ethereal to substantiate.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The investigation was based on rumors with no substantial evidence
