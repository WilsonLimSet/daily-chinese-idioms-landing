**Pronunciation:** *bǎi zhé bù náo*  
**Literal meaning:** Bend hundred times never yield

## Origin & Usage

Dating to the Warring States period, this idiom describes bamboo that bends a hundred (百) times (折) but never (不) yields (挠). The imagery comes from ancient observations of bamboo groves surviving severe storms by bending rather than breaking. The metaphor gained particular significance during the Three Kingdoms period, when strategist Zhuge Liang used it to encourage his troops during difficult campaigns. Confucian scholars later adopted it to describe moral resilience under pressure. In modern contexts, it's often invoked during times of personal or national adversity, emphasizing that true strength lies not in rigid resistance but in flexible persistence. The idiom particularly resonates in business and personal development contexts.

## Examples

**English:** "Despite numerous rejections, she never gave up on her dreams"
