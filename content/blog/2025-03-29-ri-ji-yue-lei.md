**Pronunciation:** *rì jī yuè lěi*  
**Literal meaning:** Days pile months gather

## Origin & Usage

This idiom weaves together daily (日) accumulation (积) with monthly (月) gathering (累) to describe gradual progress. It first appeared in Han Dynasty texts discussing scholarly cultivation, where learning was seen as a process of constant, minute additions - like grains of sand forming a mountain. The astronomical references reflect ancient Chinese understanding of time as both cyclical and accumulative. Modern applications range from personal development to business growth, emphasizing that significant achievements result from consistent small efforts rather than dramatic singular actions.

## Examples

**English:** "Her language skills improved through daily practice over years"

**Chinese:** 她的语言能力通过多年的日常练习得到提高
