## Origin & Usage

Song Dynasty scholars, debating the nature of probability, gave us this precise way of expressing likelihood - that out of ten cases (十), eight or nine (八九) will occur as expected. The phrase offered a mathematical precision between absolute certainty and mere possibility. Ming Dynasty merchants adopted it for practical probability assessments. Modern usage spans from weather forecasting to business planning, offering a specific confidence level rather than vague assurance.
