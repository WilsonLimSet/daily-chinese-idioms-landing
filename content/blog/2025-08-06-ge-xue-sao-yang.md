**Pronunciation:** *gé xuē sāo yǎng*  
**Literal meaning:** Scratch itch through boot

## Origin & Usage

This frustrating idiom describes scratching (搔) an itch (痒) through (隔) a boot (靴), originating from Song Dynasty vernacular literature. It first appeared in stories illustrating the futility of indirect solutions to immediate problems. The image created a perfect metaphor for ineffective efforts that fail to reach their target despite apparent activity. During the Ming Dynasty, medical texts adopted it to criticize treatments that failed to address underlying causes of disease. Unlike terms for simple failure, it specifically describes the frustration of effort applied at the wrong level or through inappropriate means. Modern usage identifies approaches that cannot succeed because they're fundamentally disconnected from the actual point of need.

## Examples

**English:** "The vague explanation failed to address the underlying problem"

**Chinese:** 这个模糊的解释未能解决根本问题
