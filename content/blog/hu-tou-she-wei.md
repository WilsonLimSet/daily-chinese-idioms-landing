**Pronunciation:** *hǔ tóu shé wěi*
**Literal meaning:** Tiger head snake tail

## Origin & Usage

Tang Dynasty literary critics gave us this image of a tiger's head (虎头) with a snake's tail (蛇尾) to describe works that begin powerfully but end weakly. Song Dynasty writers expanded it beyond literature to any project showing declining quality over time. The zoological mismatch perfectly captured the disappointment of strong starts fading into weak finishes.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The novel began with dramatic intensity but ended with a weak, rushed conclusion
