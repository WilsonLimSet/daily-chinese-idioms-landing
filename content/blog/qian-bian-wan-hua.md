**Pronunciation:** *qiān biàn wàn huà*  
**Literal meaning:** Thousand changes ten thousand transformations

## Origin & Usage

This idiom uses the large numbers 'thousand' (千) and 'ten thousand' (万) with 'change' (变) and 'transform' (化) to describe constant flux. The hyperbolic numbers emphasize the endless variety of transformations. The phrase reflects Daoist philosophy regarding the ceaseless change underlying apparent stability. It appears in texts describing nature, military situations, and human affairs. Modern usage describes highly variable or unpredictable situations, from weather patterns to market conditions to rapidly evolving technologies.
