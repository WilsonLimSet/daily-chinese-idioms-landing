**Pronunciation:** *shǒu kǒu rú píng*  
**Literal meaning:** Guard mouth like bottle

## Origin & Usage

Comparing one's mouth to a sealed bottle (瓶), this idiom emerged during the Tang Dynasty when court intrigue made discretion essential for survival. The bottle (瓶) metaphor was inspired by valuable sealed containers used for storing precious liquids, which would lose their value if opened carelessly. Historical records show how maintaining silence (守口) saved lives during political purges. In modern usage, it emphasizes professional confidentiality and the importance of keeping secrets, particularly relevant in business and personal relationships where discretion is crucial.
