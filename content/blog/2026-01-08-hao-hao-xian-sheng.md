**Pronunciation:** *hǎo hǎo xiān sheng*
**Literal meaning:** Good good mister

## Origin & Usage

Qing Dynasty political commentators first used this phrase to criticize excessively agreeable (好好) officials (先生) who prioritized harmony over necessary confrontation. The doubled character '好' (good) carried an ironic edge, suggesting performance rather than genuine virtue. Modern usage describes those who avoid all conflict through universal agreeability, even when principled disagreement would better serve the common good.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The manager avoided necessary criticism and never challenged poor performance
