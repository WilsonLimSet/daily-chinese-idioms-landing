**Pronunciation:** *hào yì wù láo*  
**Literal meaning:** Love ease hate work

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes the human tendency to love (好) ease (逸) and hate (恶) work (劳). First appearing in pre-Qin philosophical texts, it was used by Mencius to warn against the natural but problematic inclination toward comfort over effort. The phrase gained particular significance during the Song Dynasty when Neo-Confucian scholars used it to discuss moral cultivation and character development. They argued that recognizing this tendency was the first step in overcoming it. Modern usage often appears in educational and professional contexts as a reminder that success requires pushing beyond our comfort zones. It serves as both a warning against laziness and an acknowledgment that disciplined effort often goes against our natural inclinations.

## Examples
