**Pronunciation:** *cùn bù nán xíng*  
**Literal meaning:** Inch step difficult to walk

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes being unable to walk (难行) even an inch (寸步). The smallest unit of progress - a single step - becomes impossible. The phrase appeared in texts describing extreme difficulties or insurmountable obstacles. It captures the frustration of complete immobilization. Modern usage describes situations where progress is blocked entirely, whether by bureaucratic obstacles, resource constraints, or opposition that makes even minimal advancement impossible.

## Examples

**English:** "Without proper documentation, progress was impossible."

**Chinese:** 没有适当的文件，工作寸步难行。
