**Pronunciation:** *jí liú yǒng jìn*  
**Literal meaning:** Rapids bravely advance

## Origin & Usage

This dynamic idiom describes bravely (勇) advancing (进) through rapid (急) currents (流), emerging from Tang Dynasty descriptions of skilled boatmen navigating the treacherous Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. The phrase gained political significance during the Song Dynasty, when reformer Wang Anshi used it to encourage progressive policies against conservative resistance. The river metaphor resonated deeply in Chinese culture, where waterways represented both opportunity and danger. Unlike idioms advocating caution, it celebrates bold progress amid turbulent conditions. Modern usage often appears in business contexts describing companies that expand during economic downturns or individuals who advance careers during institutional upheaval.

## Examples

**English:** "The startup aggressively expanded during market turbulence while competitors retreated"

**Chinese:** 当竞争对手退缩时，这家初创公司在市场动荡期间积极扩张
