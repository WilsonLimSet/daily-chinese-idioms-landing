**Pronunciation:** *yú gōng yí shān*  
**Literal meaning:** Foolish old man moves mountains

## Origin & Usage

This persistent idiom tells of a determined old man (愚公) who began removing (移) mountains (山) that blocked his path, originating from the 'Liezi' during the Warring States period. When ridiculed for attempting such an impossible task at his advanced age, he replied that while he might die, his descendants would continue until the mountains were gone. The gods, moved by his persistence, ordered the mountains removed. During the Han Dynasty, the story became emblematic of the power of multigenerational effort against seemingly impossible challenges. Modern usage celebrates determined perseverance against overwhelming obstacles, particularly projects requiring sustained effort over extended periods, teaching that consistent application of effort can overcome even the most imposing challenges.

**English:** "Despite overwhelming obstacles, the small team persisted until they revolutionized the industry"
