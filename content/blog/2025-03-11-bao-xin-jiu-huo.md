**Pronunciation:** *bào xīn jiù huǒ*  
**Literal meaning:** Carry wood save fire

## Origin & Usage

This paradoxical image of carrying (抱) firewood (薪) to extinguish (救) a fire (火) emerged during the Warring States period as a metaphor for self-defeating actions. Historical records show it being used to criticize policies that appeared helpful but actually worsened situations. The image was particularly powerful in ancient China, where wood was both essential fuel and a major fire hazard in urban areas. Today, it describes counterproductive solutions that aggravate the problems they attempt to solve, from misguided economic policies to relationship interventions that increase conflict.

## Examples

**English:** "Their hasty solution only complicated the existing issues"

**Chinese:** 他们仓促的解决方案只是使现有问题更加复杂
