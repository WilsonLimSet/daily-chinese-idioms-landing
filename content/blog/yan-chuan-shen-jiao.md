## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes teaching through words (言传) and personal example (身教). It recognizes that instruction involves both verbal teaching and modeling behavior. Actions often teach more powerfully than words. Modern usage emphasizes the importance of practicing what one preaches, recognizing that children and students learn as much from observing behavior as from formal instruction.
