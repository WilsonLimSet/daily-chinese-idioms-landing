**Pronunciation:** *sān sī ér xíng*  
**Literal meaning:** Think three times then act

## Origin & Usage

First recorded in the Analects of Confucius, where the Master responded to Zengzi's interpretation of reflection (思) three times (三) before action (行). The number three held significance in Confucian thought, representing completeness. During the Song Dynasty, philosophers expanded this concept into a systematic approach to decision-making: examining a matter's past precedent, present circumstances, and future implications. This methodical approach influenced Chinese bureaucratic practices for centuries. Today, it advocates for careful deliberation in an age of rapid decisions, particularly in professional and personal life-changing choices.

## Examples

**English:** "She carefully considered all implications before making the decision"

**Chinese:** 她在做决定之前仔细考虑了所有影响
