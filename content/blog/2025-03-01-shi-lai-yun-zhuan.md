**Pronunciation:** *shí lái yùn zhuǎn*  
**Literal meaning:** Time comes and fortune turns

## Origin & Usage

This optimistic idiom describes the moment when time arrives (时来) and fortune turns (运转). It emerged from the practice of divination during the Zhou Dynasty, where fortune was seen as cyclical rather than fixed. The concept gained particular resonance during the Tang Dynasty, as stories spread of scholars who succeeded at the imperial examinations after years of failure. The phrase captures both the periodic nature of opportunity and the importance of persisting until fortune's wheel turns in one's favor.

## Examples

**English:** "After years of struggle, his business finally found its market opportunity"

**Chinese:** 经过多年的奋斗，他的企业终于找到了市场机会
