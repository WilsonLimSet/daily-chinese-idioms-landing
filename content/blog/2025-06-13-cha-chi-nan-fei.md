**Pronunciation:** *chā chì nán fēi*  
**Literal meaning:** Add wings difficult fly

## Origin & Usage

This vivid idiom suggests that even adding (插) wings (翅) wouldn't make escape possible (难飞), originating from Tang Dynasty prison terminology. Historical records describe how imperial prisons were designed so securely that the metaphorical addition of wings wouldn't enable flight. The phrase gained wider circulation during the Song Dynasty, appearing in official communications about apprehending serious offenders. The imagery was particularly powerful as wings represented the ultimate freedom in Chinese poetry. Modern usage describes inescapable situations of all kinds, from legal predicaments to business commitments with no exit clauses, emphasizing how certain circumstances remain binding despite extraordinary efforts to escape them.

## Examples

**English:** "The criminal found escape impossible despite elaborate plans"

**Chinese:** 尽管有精心策划，罪犯发现逃脱是不可能的
