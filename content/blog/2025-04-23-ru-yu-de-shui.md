**Pronunciation:** *rú yú dé shuǐ*  
**Literal meaning:** Fish finds water

## Origin & Usage

This idiom captures the harmony between fish (鱼) and water (水), drawing from Daoist observations of natural affinities. In ancient texts, particularly those of Zhuangzi, the fish swimming effortlessly through water epitomized the ideal state of being perfectly suited to one's environment. The metaphor gained prominence during the Tang Dynasty when poets used it to describe the relationship between talented officials and enlightened rulers. Modern usage extends beyond professional contexts to any situation where someone thrives naturally in their element – whether an artist in their studio, an athlete in their sport, or a teacher in their classroom. It speaks to the profound satisfaction found when one's talents align perfectly with their circumstances.

## Examples

**English:** "The experienced teacher in her new classroom was like a fish in water"
