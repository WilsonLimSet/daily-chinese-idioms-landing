## Origin & Usage

This formal idiom combines totality (总) with expression (言之) through a linking particle (而), emerging directly from Han Dynasty scholarly writing rather than narrative origins. During the Song Dynasty, it became standard in academic conclusions as Neo-Confucian scholars systematized knowledge presentation. Unlike most Chinese idioms, it developed from formal rhetoric rather than metaphorical imagery. The character progression creates logical flow - gathering scattered elements before articulating their essence. Modern usage spans academic writing to business presentations, signaling the distillation of complex information into essential points.
