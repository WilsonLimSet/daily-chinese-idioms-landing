**Pronunciation:** *máng rén mō xiàng*  
**Literal meaning:** Blind person touches elephant

## Origin & Usage

This profound metaphor shows blind (盲) people (人) touching (摸) an elephant (象), coming from a Buddhist parable that entered China during the Eastern Jin Dynasty. During the Tang Dynasty, it became central to philosophical discussions about the limitations of individual perspective. The tactile imagery perfectly illustrated how direct but limited experience can create confident but incomplete knowledge. Modern usage particularly applies to complex systems analysis, where experts in narrow domains might mistake their specialized insight for comprehensive understanding.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Each department understood only their aspect of the problem, missing the complete picture
