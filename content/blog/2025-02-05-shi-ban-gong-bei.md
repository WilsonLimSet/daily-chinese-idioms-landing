**Pronunciation:** *shì bàn gōng bèi*  
**Literal meaning:** Half effort double result

## Origin & Usage

This mathematical idiom describes situations where half (半) the effort (事) yields double (倍) the result (功). First appearing in Han Dynasty agricultural texts, it originally described efficient farming techniques that maximized yield while minimizing labor. The concept gained broader application during the Song Dynasty's technological innovations, where mechanical improvements demonstrated its principle. In modern contexts, it celebrates smart work over hard work, particularly in business process optimization and technological innovation. The idiom has found renewed relevance in the digital age, where automation and artificial intelligence exemplify its wisdom – achieving exponentially better results through strategic efficiency rather than increased effort.

## Examples
