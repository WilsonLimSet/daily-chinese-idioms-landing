**Pronunciation:** *guǎi wān mò jiǎo*
**Literal meaning:** Turn corners wipe angles

## Origin & Usage

Ming Dynasty urban guides first used this phrase to describe physical paths that turn corners (拐弯) and smooth angles (抹角). Qing Dynasty diplomatic writing adopted it for conversational indirectness. The spatial metaphor perfectly captured how communication can avoid direct routes while still reaching its destination. Today it describes any deliberately indirect approach, whether in diplomacy or personal requests.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Instead of directly asking for a raise, he spoke vaguely about compensation and market rates
