## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes continuing (承) from above (上) while opening/initiating (启) what's below (下). It originated in literary criticism describing transitional passages that connect previous content to what follows. The phrase emphasizes the crucial role of elements that bridge different levels or sections. It values connectors that maintain continuity while enabling progression. Modern usage commonly describes middle positions that transmit information and direction both upward and downward in hierarchies.
