**Pronunciation:** *lè yú zhù rén*
**Literal meaning:** Happy to help people

## Origin & Usage

This phrase originated from Confucian ethical teachings in the Analects compiled around 500 BCE. The concept appears in Confucius' discussions of different motivations for virtuous action, with internal happiness representing the highest form. During the Han Dynasty, it became central to official assessments of moral character. Finding joy (乐) in helping others (助人) had a particularly significant emotional emphasis—distinguishing assistance motivated by genuine pleasure from duty-bound reluctant help. Unlike terms simply meaning 'helpful,' it specifically celebrates the psychological enjoyment derived from assisting others rather than just the action itself. Modern usage spans character references to volunteer recruitment, describing the psychological orientation that transforms helping from obligation to pleasure, particularly valuing sustained helpfulness arising from genuine internal satisfaction rather than external recognition.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The volunteer spent weekends helping elderly neighbors with home repairs
