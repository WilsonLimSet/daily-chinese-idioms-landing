**Pronunciation:** *yī shì tóng rén*  
**Literal meaning:** One view same benevolence

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes viewing (视) everyone with the same (一同) benevolence (仁). The Confucian concept of 'ren' (仁, benevolence) is extended equally to all without discrimination. The phrase appeared in texts discussing ideal governance and moral conduct. It represents the virtue of impartiality in treatment, transcending differences in status, origin, or relationship. Modern usage praises fair treatment that doesn't favor some over others, particularly important in leadership, teaching, and service contexts.

## Examples

**English:** "The teacher treats all students equally regardless of background."

**Chinese:** 老师对所有学生一视同仁，不论背景。
