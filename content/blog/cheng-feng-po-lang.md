**Pronunciation:** *chéng fēng pò làng*
**Literal meaning:** Ride wind break waves

## Origin & Usage

Li Bai's bold verse from the Tang Dynasty - 'Straight ahead, ride the wind (乘风) and break through waves (破浪)' - gave us this dynamic image of progress through adversity. Originally maritime terminology, Song Dynasty writers transformed it into a broader metaphor for advancement through challenges. The nautical imagery perfectly captures the dual nature of progress - both harnessing favorable forces while actively overcoming resistance. Today it inspires entrepreneurs and innovators facing their own metaphorical seas.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The startup boldly expanded during economic turbulence while competitors retreated
