**Pronunciation:** *yī gǔ zuò qì*  
**Literal meaning:** One drum make spirit

## Origin & Usage

Derived from the ancient military treatise 'Guan Zi', this idiom describes how soldiers' spirits (气) rise highest at the first drum (一鼓) beat before battle. The text observes that morale diminishes with each subsequent drumbeat, making the initial surge of energy crucial. During the Warring States period, military commanders used this understanding of psychological momentum to time their attacks. The drum's significance in ancient Chinese warfare adds depth to the metaphor - it was not just a signal but a tool for maintaining troop coordination and morale. Today, it emphasizes the importance of seizing initial momentum in any challenging endeavor.

## Examples
