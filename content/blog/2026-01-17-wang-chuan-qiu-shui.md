## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from Tang Dynasty poetry, where 'autumn waters' (秋水) was a literary metaphor for bright, clear eyes. The phrase describes looking so intently and longingly that one's gaze seems to pierce through clear autumn waters. It gained prominence through the works of poet Wang Bo and later appeared in the famous Yuan Dynasty drama 'The West Chamber' (西厢记). The idiom captures the intensity of longing and anticipation, particularly in romantic contexts. In modern usage, it describes eagerly awaiting someone's arrival or news, conveying deep emotional attachment and patient hope.
