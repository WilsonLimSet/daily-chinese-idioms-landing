**Pronunciation:** *míng liè qián máo*  
**Literal meaning:** Name listed among the front reeds

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from ancient Chinese military practice where commanders at the front of an army carried 'mao' (茅), a type of reed grass, as signal markers. To have one's name (名) listed (列) among the front reeds (前茅) meant being at the vanguard. The phrase evolved to describe being among the top performers in any ranking or competition. Modern usage commonly describes academic achievement, sports rankings, or business performance that places someone among the leaders.
