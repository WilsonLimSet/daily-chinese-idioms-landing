**Pronunciation:** *tiān yī wú fèng*  
**Literal meaning:** Heavenly garment without seams

## Origin & Usage

This flawless idiom describes celestial garments (天衣) without (无) seams (缝), originating from Buddhist sutras introduced during the Eastern Han Dynasty. These texts described how deities wore perfect garments manifested naturally without human construction, hence lacking seams found in earthly clothing. During the Tang Dynasty, as Buddhism flourished, the phrase expanded beyond religious contexts to represent ideal execution in any field. The clothing metaphor was particularly meaningful in Chinese culture, where garment construction and quality indicated social status. Modern usage describes perfect execution or seamless integration, particularly in contexts requiring multiple components to function as a unified whole, suggesting the highest achievement often appears as though naturally manifested rather than constructed.

## Examples

**English:** "The integration of the two companies was so perfect no operational disruptions occurred"

**Chinese:** 两家公司的整合如此完美，没有发生任何运营中断
