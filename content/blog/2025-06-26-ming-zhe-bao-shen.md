**Pronunciation:** *míng zhé bǎo shēn*  
**Literal meaning:** Wise person protects self

## Origin & Usage

This pragmatic idiom suggests the wise (明哲) person protects (保) themselves (身), emerging during the turbulent period following the Han Dynasty's collapse. Historical records show it was first used to describe officials who withdrew from dangerous political situations to preserve their safety. The concept gained prominence during the Wei-Jin period of chaotic dynastic transitions, when scholarship on righteous retreat flourished. Unlike terms for simple cowardice, it carries nuanced implications about timing and discernment. Modern usage describes strategic self-preservation in volatile situations, though it often carries slight moral ambiguity - acknowledging the wisdom of self-protection while questioning potential abandonment of greater responsibilities.

## Examples

**English:** "The executive quietly resigned before the company scandal became public"

**Chinese:** 在公司丑闻公开之前，这位高管悄悄辞职了
