**Pronunciation:** *kǒu mì fù jiàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Mouth honey belly sword

## Origin & Usage

This vivid idiom contrasts honey (蜜) in the mouth (口) with swords (剑) in the belly (腹), originating from Tang Dynasty political discourse. It was first recorded in descriptions of court officials who spoke pleasantly while harboring harmful intentions. The imagery draws from the traditional Chinese medical concept of internal organs housing both physical and emotional attributes. The stark contrast between sweet words and hidden malice made it a powerful warning in diplomatic texts. Modern usage describes two-faced behavior in professional or personal relationships, particularly in situations where pleasant superficiality masks hostile intent.
