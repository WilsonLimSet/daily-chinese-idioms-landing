**Pronunciation:** *pò fǔ chén zhōu*  
**Literal meaning:** Break pots sink boats

## Origin & Usage

Originating from a famous historical event in 207 BCE, this idiom recounts how general Xiang Yu ordered his troops to break (破) their cooking pots (釜) and sink (沉) their boats (舟) before battling the Qin army. By eliminating the possibility of retreat, he created absolute commitment to victory. During the Three Kingdoms period, this story became a classic example of decisive leadership and psychological warfare. The four characters create a powerful image of burning bridges to ensure total dedication. In modern contexts, it describes situations where success requires eliminating backup plans - from entrepreneurs investing all their resources to career changers making irreversible decisions. It teaches that certain achievements become possible only when retreat is no longer an option.

## Examples

**English:** "He quit his job to start a business, fully committed to success"

**Chinese:** 他辞去工作创业，全身心投入追求成功
