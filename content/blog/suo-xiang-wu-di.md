**Pronunciation:** *suǒ xiàng wú dí*  
**Literal meaning:** Wherever directed, no enemies

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes wherever (所) directed (向), having no (无) enemies (敌). Similar to 所向披靡, it depicts invincibility. The phrase emphasizes the absence of worthy opposition rather than their defeat. Modern usage describes peak dominance when one has no real competitors, periods when superiority is so complete that challenges don't arise.

## Examples

**English:** "At his peak, no competitor could challenge him."

**Chinese:** 在巅峰时期，他所向无敌。
