**Pronunciation:** *cè mù ér shì*
**Literal meaning:** Side eye and look

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty court etiquette manuals first described this technique of looking (视) with eyes turned sideways (侧目) as a way for lower officials to show restrained curiosity or disapproval without direct staring. Tang Dynasty literary works expanded it into a subtle tool for character development, showing skepticism or disdain through described body language. The visual angle perfectly captures the balance between observation and emotional distance.
