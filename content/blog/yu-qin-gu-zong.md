**Pronunciation:** *yù qín gù zòng*  
**Literal meaning:** Wishing to capture, first let go

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes wanting (欲) to capture (擒) but intentionally (故) letting go (纵). It is one of the Thirty-Six Stratagems where releasing a target creates false security before the final capture. Zhuge Liang famously used this strategy, capturing and releasing Meng Huo seven times until he surrendered genuinely. Modern usage describes patience in pursuit and the psychology of capture.

## Examples

**English:** "The detective pretended to drop the case to make the suspect lower his guard."

**Chinese:** 侦探假装放弃案件，欲擒故纵，让嫌疑人放松警惕。
