**Pronunciation:** *yī nuò qiān jīn*  
**Literal meaning:** One promise thousand gold

## Origin & Usage

Emerging from the Spring and Autumn period, this idiom equates one (一) promise (诺) with a thousand in gold (千金). It gained prominence through the story of Ji Zha, who honored a posthumous promise despite great personal cost. The concept became central to merchant culture during the Tang Dynasty, where reputation often carried more value than material wealth. It emphasizes how trustworthiness creates lasting value beyond immediate gains. Modern applications stress the importance of integrity in business relationships and personal commitments, suggesting that reliability builds more sustainable success than short-term profit.

## Examples

**English:** "Despite better offers, she honored her original commitment to the client"

**Chinese:** 尽管有更好的机会，她仍然信守对客户的承诺
