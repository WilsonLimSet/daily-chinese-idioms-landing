**Pronunciation:** *zhòng suǒ zhōu zhī*
**Literal meaning:** Everyone completely knows

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty imperial edicts first employed this phrase to establish what everyone (众) completely (周) knows (知) before introducing new policies. Tang Dynasty scholars refined it into a sophisticated rhetorical tool for distinguishing established knowledge from novel arguments. As literacy spread during the Song Dynasty, it evolved from formal documentation into everyday speech. Modern usage maintains its subtle power - simultaneously establishing common ground, invoking social validation, and gently pressuring dissenters through suggested consensus.

## When to Use

**Situation:** It is widely accepted that regular exercise contributes to better health outcomes
