**Pronunciation:** *chún wáng chǐ hán*  
**Literal meaning:** Lips gone teeth cold

## Origin & Usage

This vivid metaphor emerged from the Warring States period, when advisor Li Ke warned the state of Wei about abandoning its ally. He explained that when lips (唇) perish (亡), teeth (齿) grow cold (寒), illustrating their mutual dependence. The metaphor resonated deeply in Chinese diplomatic thought, appearing in numerous historical treaties and alliances. Originally describing political interdependence, it evolved to represent any symbiotic relationship. Modern usage spans business partnerships to environmental conservation, highlighting how the fate of seemingly different entities is often intertwined. The imagery's physiological accuracy helped it endure as a powerful reminder of interconnectedness.
