**Pronunciation:** *zuǒ yòu féng yuán*  
**Literal meaning:** Left right meet springs

## Origin & Usage

This fortunate idiom describes encountering (逢) springs/resources (源) whether turning left or right (左右), originating from Tang Dynasty descriptions of ideal terrain for settlement. It initially described geographical locations where water sources were abundant in all directions, representing perfect natural prosperity. During the Song Dynasty, it evolved to describe political figures who maintained good relationships with competing factions. The water metaphor was particularly meaningful in agricultural society, where accessible springs determined community prosperity. Modern usage describes individuals who successfully navigate complex situations with multiple beneficial options or maintain productive relationships across different groups, suggesting both skill and fortunate circumstances.
