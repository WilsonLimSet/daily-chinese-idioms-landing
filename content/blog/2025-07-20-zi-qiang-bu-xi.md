**Pronunciation:** *zì qiáng bù xī*  
**Literal meaning:** Self-strengthen without ceasing

## Origin & Usage

This motivational idiom advocates constantly (不息) strengthening (强) oneself (自), originating from the Classic of Changes during the early Zhou Dynasty. It represented one of the fundamental virtues attributed to Heaven's ceaseless motion and energy. Confucian scholars later emphasized it as the superior person's approach to self-cultivation and moral development. During the late Qing Dynasty, it gained renewed significance as a national motto during modernization efforts, emphasizing China's need for internal renewal. Unlike terms for simple effort, it specifically emphasizes internal development rather than external comparison. Modern usage encourages continuous self-improvement regardless of circumstances, particularly in contexts of personal development, national renewal, or organizational transformation.
