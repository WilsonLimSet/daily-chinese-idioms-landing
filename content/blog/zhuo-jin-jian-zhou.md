**Pronunciation:** *zhuō jīn jiàn zhǒu*  
**Literal meaning:** Pulling collar reveals elbows

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes clothing so worn that pulling (捉) the collar (襟) reveals (见) the elbows (肘). The vivid image of poverty - clothes so tattered they cannot cover the body - originated in historical descriptions of destitute scholars. The phrase evolved to describe any situation of severe shortage where resources are insufficient to cover basic needs. Modern usage commonly describes tight budgets, understaffing, or any situation where demands exceed available resources.

## Examples

**English:** "The budget constraints left the department financially stretched."

**Chinese:** 预算限制让部门捉襟见肘。
