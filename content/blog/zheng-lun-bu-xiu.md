**Pronunciation:** *zhēng lùn bù xiū*  
**Literal meaning:** Arguing without rest

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes arguing (争论) without (不) stopping (休). The phrase captures the frustration of debates that continue indefinitely without resolution. It appeared in historical texts describing court factions locked in perpetual disagreement. The idiom suggests both the intensity of disagreement and its unproductive nature when no conclusion is reached. Modern usage describes prolonged debates, ongoing controversies, or persistent disagreements that resist resolution.

## Examples

**English:** "The committee debated the issue endlessly without reaching a conclusion."

**Chinese:** 委员会对这个问题争论不休，却始终没有结论。
