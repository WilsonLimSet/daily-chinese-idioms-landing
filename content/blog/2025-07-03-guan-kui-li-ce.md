**Pronunciation:** *guǎn kuī lí cè*  
**Literal meaning:** Tube view gourd measure

## Origin & Usage

This humble idiom compares limited understanding to viewing (窥) through a tube (管) and measuring (测) the ocean with a gourd ladle (蠡), originating from Han Dynasty skeptical philosophy. It first appeared in texts discussing the limitations of human knowledge when confronting vast natural phenomena. The specific tools mentioned were commonplace items, emphasizing how ordinary human perception fails to grasp ultimate reality. During the Song Dynasty, Neo-Confucian scholars used it to encourage intellectual humility when studying classical texts. Unlike simple admissions of ignorance, it acknowledges attempts to understand while recognizing their inherent limitations. Modern usage often prefaces scholarly work to acknowledge methodological constraints or appears in scientific contexts discussing the provisional nature of knowledge.

## Examples

**English:** "The limited study provided only a narrow perspective on the complex social phenomenon"

**Chinese:** 这项有限的研究仅提供了对这一复杂社会现象的片面看法
