**Pronunciation:** *xiāng rú yǐ mò*  
**Literal meaning:** Moisten each other with foam

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes moistening each other (相濡) with foam (以沫). From Zhuangzi's parable of fish in a drying pond who keep each other alive by sharing their foam. Though Zhuangzi suggested freedom was better, the phrase came to represent devoted mutual support during hardship. Modern usage describes couples or friends helping each other survive difficult times through mutual care.

## Examples

**English:** "The elderly couple supported each other through their difficult years."

**Chinese:** 这对老夫妻在困难岁月里相濡以沫。
