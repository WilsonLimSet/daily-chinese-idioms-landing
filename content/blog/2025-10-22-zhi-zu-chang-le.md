**Pronunciation:** *zhī zú cháng lè*
**Literal meaning:** Know enough constant happiness

## Origin & Usage

Laozi's profound insight in the 'Dao De Jing' teaches that knowing contentment (知足) leads to lasting happiness (常乐). The concept resonated deeply with both Daoist and Buddhist traditions, each recognizing how mental recognition of 'enough' creates more joy than endless acquisition. Tang Dynasty writers expanded its influence beyond philosophical circles into broader cultural discourse. In our modern age of constant consumption, this ancient wisdom offers a powerful alternative to the cycle of perpetual want.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Despite modest circumstances, the family found contentment in simple pleasures and each other's company
