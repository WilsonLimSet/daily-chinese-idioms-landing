**Pronunciation:** *hǔ jù lóng pán*
**Literal meaning:** Tiger crouch dragon coil

## Origin & Usage

Three Kingdoms period geographers first described Nanjing's terrain as having tigers crouching (虎踞) and dragons coiling (龙盘). The image combined earth's greatest predator with its supreme mythical creature to capture the city's naturally commanding position. Tang Dynasty writers expanded it to describe any position of overwhelming natural advantage. Modern strategic thinking still values such inherent positional strength.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The ancient fortress commanded the mountain pass with intimidating strategic position
