**Pronunciation:** *lǐ suǒ dāng rán*  
**Literal meaning:** What reason dictates as natural

## Origin & Usage

This idiom combines 'according to reason' (理所) with 'naturally so' (当然) to express what logic and propriety dictate as obvious or appropriate. The concept of 'li' (理) in Neo-Confucian philosophy represents the rational principle underlying all things. The phrase suggests alignment between expectation and cosmic order. It appeared in Song Dynasty philosophical texts discussing moral imperatives. Modern usage can express either genuine natural logic or, sometimes critically, assumptions that may actually warrant questioning.

## Examples

**English:** "It's only natural that hard work leads to success."

**Chinese:** 努力工作会带来成功，这是理所当然的。
