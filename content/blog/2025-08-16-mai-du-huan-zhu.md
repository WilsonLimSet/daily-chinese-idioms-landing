**Pronunciation:** *mǎi dú huán zhū*  
**Literal meaning:** Buy case, return pearl

## Origin & Usage

This misguided idiom describes buying (买) a decorative box (椟) but returning (还) the pearl (珠) inside, originating from the Warring States period text 'Han Feizi.' It tells of a merchant from Chu who offered a valuable pearl in a beautifully carved box. The buyer from Zheng was so captivated by the ornate container that he purchased it but returned the pearl, completely missing the true value. The tale gained prominence during the Han Dynasty as a metaphor for mistaking superficial appearances for real worth. Unlike terms for simple foolishness, it specifically criticizes valuing ornamental packaging over substantive content. Modern usage describes prioritizing superficial elements while overlooking genuine value, particularly relevant in consumer culture and aesthetics.

## Examples

**English:** "The collector purchased the elaborate frame but returned the valuable painting it contained"

**Chinese:** 收藏家购买了精美的画框，却退回了其中的名贵画作
