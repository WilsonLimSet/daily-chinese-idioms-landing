**Pronunciation:** *hú shuō bā dào*
**Literal meaning:** Reckless speak eight ways

## Origin & Usage

Ming Dynasty vernacular speech gave us this colorful description of reckless speaking (胡说) scattered in eight directions (八道). Qing Dynasty scholars used it to criticize statements completely disconnected from evidence or logic. The image of words scattered in all directions perfectly captured the chaos of unfounded assertions. Modern usage spans from conspiracy theories to any confidently stated nonsense.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The conspiracy theorist's explanation lacked any factual foundation
