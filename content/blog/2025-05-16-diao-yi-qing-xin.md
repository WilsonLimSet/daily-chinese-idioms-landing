**Pronunciation:** *diào yǐ qīng xīn*  
**Literal meaning:** Drop heart light

## Origin & Usage

A Warring States period warning about the dangers of dropping (掉) one's guard with a light (轻) heart (心). The idiom gained significance through military treatises where letting down one's vigilance often led to defeat. Historical accounts detail numerous battles lost due to overconfidence rather than inferior strength. The concept became central to strategic thinking, emphasizing that maintaining alertness is as crucial as possessing capability. Modern applications extend to business competition, cybersecurity, and personal development, warning against complacency when things appear to be going well. It reminds that success often requires sustained attention rather than momentary achievement.

## Examples

**English:** "The leading company's complacency allowed competitors to catch up"

**Chinese:** 领先公司的自满让竞争对手迎头赶上
