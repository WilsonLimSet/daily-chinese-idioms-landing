**Pronunciation:** *ān bù dāng chē*
**Literal meaning:** Peaceful walking substitutes carriage

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from the 'Eastern Han Records' biography of Cui Yuan, an official who declined the emperor's gift of a carriage, preferring to walk and appreciate nature's beauty. During the Tang Dynasty, it became emblematic of the scholarly ideal of finding joy in simplicity. The contrast between walking (步) peacefully (安) as a substitute for (当) riding in carriages (车) was particularly meaningful in pre-modern China where vehicle ownership signified status. Unlike terms simply meaning 'humble,' it celebrates the deliberate choice of simpler alternatives for their inherent rewards rather than mere status rejection. Modern usage spans lifestyle choices to leisure activities, describing voluntary simplification that sacrifices convenience for more authentic engagement, particularly when slowing down enhances appreciation of surrounding beauty.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Rather than rushing between appointments, she chose to walk and enjoy the scenery
