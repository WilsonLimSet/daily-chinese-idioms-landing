**Pronunciation:** *fù shuǐ nán shōu*  
**Literal meaning:** Spilled water hard to recover

## Origin & Usage

This irreversible idiom states that water once spilled (覆水) is difficult (难) to gather back (收), originating from Tang Dynasty poetry. It first appeared in a poem about irrevocable separation between husband and wife, comparing their relationship to water impossible to return to its container once poured out. The water metaphor was particularly powerful in Chinese philosophy, where flowing water symbolized both time and opportunity that cannot be recaptured. During the Song Dynasty, it expanded beyond relationships to represent any irreversible action. Modern usage describes situations where consequences cannot be undone, particularly decisions, words, or actions with permanent effects, teaching the importance of careful consideration before taking irreversible steps.
