**Pronunciation:** *rào liáng sān rì*  
**Literal meaning:** Lingering around beams for days

## Origin & Usage

This resonant idiom describes music lingering (绕) around ceiling beams (梁) for three (三) days (日), originating from the Spring and Autumn period. Historical accounts tell of legendary musician Boya's performance so moving that the sound remained in the hall for days afterward. The specific architectural reference to roof beams connected to classical Chinese building design, where open beam ceilings could create acoustic resonance. During the Tang Dynasty, music critics adopted it to describe compositions with lasting impact beyond their performance. Modern usage describes any aesthetic experience with powerful, lingering effects on the audience, particularly artistic performances or expressions that continue to resonate emotionally long after the initial exposure.

## Examples

**English:** "The singer's haunting melody remained in everyone's minds long after the concert ended"

**Chinese:** 这位歌手悠扬的旋律在音乐会结束很久后仍萦绕在每个人心中
