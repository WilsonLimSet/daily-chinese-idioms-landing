**Pronunciation:** *cāng hǎi sāng tián*
**Literal meaning:** Blue sea mulberry field

## Origin & Usage

Ancient Daoist texts first recorded this observation of how blue seas (沧海) become mulberry fields (桑田) over time. The 'Liezi' collection used it to illustrate the profound transformations possible over centuries. Han Dynasty writers transformed it into a metaphor for any fundamental change requiring vast spans of time. The image gains particular power from the complete opposition of the environments - from deepest ocean to cultivated field.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The once-thriving industrial city had transformed into an abandoned ghost town
