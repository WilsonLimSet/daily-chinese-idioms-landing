## Origin & Usage

Rooted in military strategy, this idiom describes making crucial decisions behind the curtains (帷幄) of a military command tent while planning (运筹) campaigns. It gained prominence through records of Liu Bang, founder of the Han Dynasty, who was praised for his strategic planning abilities within his command tent before battles. The curtain (帷) created a private space where generals could analyze intelligence and devise strategies. Modern usage extends to business and political contexts, describing behind-the-scenes strategic planning and decision-making. It emphasizes the importance of thorough preparation before taking action.
