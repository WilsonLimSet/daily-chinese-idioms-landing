**Pronunciation:** *míng cún shí wáng*  
**Literal meaning:** Name exists reality gone

## Origin & Usage

This discrepant idiom describes situations where the name/form (名) continues to exist (存) while the substance/reality (实) has perished (亡), originating from Han Dynasty political analysis. It first appeared in court historian Sima Qian's assessments of declining institutions that maintained formal existence without actual function. The specific contrast between name and reality reflected core concerns in Chinese legalist and Confucian thought about alignment between appearances and substance. During the Tang Dynasty, it became standard terminology in governance critique. Unlike terms for simple deception, it describes situations where formal structures persist after their practical effectiveness has disappeared. Modern usage identifies institutions, relationships, or arrangements that continue nominally while having lost their original purpose or power.

## Examples
