## Origin & Usage

From the meticulous historical chronicles of the Han Dynasty comes this elegant description of growth that increases (增) in tandem (俱) with the passing days (与日). Tang Dynasty poets adopted the phrase to capture the gradual intensification of emotions over time. The sun's daily appearance serves as the perfect metaphor for reliable, steady progression. In contemporary contexts, it describes everything from economic trends to personal development, capturing the power of consistent, daily advancement rather than dramatic but unsustainable leaps.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Public interest in environmental issues has grown steadily over the past decade
