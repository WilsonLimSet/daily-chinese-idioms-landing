## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes long (长) years (年) with accumulated (累) months (月), emphasizing extended duration. The repetition of time units reinforces the sense of prolonged periods. The phrase appeared in historical texts describing gradual processes that unfold over extended timeframes. It emphasizes that some developments require or result from sustained periods rather than sudden events. Modern usage describes anything that develops, accumulates, or deteriorates over extended periods.
