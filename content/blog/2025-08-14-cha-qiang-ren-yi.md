**Pronunciation:** *chà qiáng rén yì*  
**Literal meaning:** Barely satisfies expectations

## Origin & Usage

This nuanced idiom describes something that somewhat (差) forcefully (强) satisfies (人意) expectations, originating from Han Dynasty literary criticism. Interestingly, its meaning evolved significantly - originally indicating exceeding expectations, it gradually shifted to describe barely adequate performance. The change occurred during the Northern Song period, creating a semantic reversal that confuses even native speakers. The character '差' caused this ambiguity, as it can mean either 'somewhat' or 'differ from' depending on pronunciation. During the Qing Dynasty, scholars standardized its current meaning of marginally acceptable quality. Modern usage describes performance meeting minimum standards without excellence, particularly in evaluations where basic requirements are satisfied without impressive quality.

## Examples

**English:** "The project's results were acceptable but not impressive"

**Chinese:** 项目的结果可以接受，但并不令人印象深刻
