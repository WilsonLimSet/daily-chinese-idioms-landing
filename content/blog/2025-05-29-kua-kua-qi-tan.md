**Pronunciation:** *kuā kuā qí tán*  
**Literal meaning:** Talk big and empty

## Origin & Usage

This critical idiom emerged during the Warring States period when advisors would boast (夸) excessively (夸) in their (其) speeches (谈). Historical accounts describe how certain ministers would make grand promises but deliver little results. The repetition of '夸' emphasizes the emptiness of such speech. The phrase gained renewed relevance during the Ming Dynasty when scholar-officials criticized the trend of style over substance in examination essays. Today, it's often used to describe corporate jargon, political rhetoric, or any discourse that favors grandiose expression over meaningful content.

## Examples

**English:** "The consultant made grand promises but delivered little results"
