## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes feelings or wishes (情愿) from only one side (一厢). It depicts expectations that exist only in one party's mind without reciprocation or basis in reality. The phrase appeared in texts describing unrequited feelings and unfounded assumptions. It warns against projecting one's desires onto situations without evidence. Modern usage describes wishful thinking, one-sided assumptions, or expectations not grounded in mutual agreement or reality.
