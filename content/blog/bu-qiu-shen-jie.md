**Pronunciation:** *bù qiú shèn jiě*  
**Literal meaning:** Not seeking thorough understanding

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes not (不) seeking (求) thorough (甚) understanding (解). It originated from Tao Yuanming's essay where he described his reading style as enjoying books without demanding deep understanding of every detail. This can be positive (appreciating the gestalt) or negative (superficiality). Modern usage often criticizes shallow engagement with material, though it sometimes positively describes a relaxed, enjoyment-focused approach to reading.

## Examples

**English:** "His superficial reading left him with only a shallow understanding."

**Chinese:** 他浅尝辄止的阅读让他不求甚解。
