**Pronunciation:** *bù bēi bù kàng*  
**Literal meaning:** Neither humble nor proud

## Origin & Usage

This balanced idiom advocates being neither (不) servile (卑) nor (不) arrogant (亢), originating from Confucian texts of the Warring States period. It first appeared in discussions of proper bearing for scholars serving in government, emphasizing dignified self-respect without overweening pride. The specific virtue of maintaining perfect equilibrium between extremes reflected the Confucian value of moderation. During the Han Dynasty, it became a standard evaluation criterion for official conduct in diplomatic contexts. Unlike terms for simple politeness, it specifically addresses power dynamics in situations of status differential. Modern usage describes ideal behavior in hierarchical contexts, from international relations to workplace interactions, where maintaining appropriate dignity without either subservience or aggression is crucial.

## Examples

**English:** "The diplomat maintained perfect dignity when negotiating with the superpower representatives"

**Chinese:** 这位外交官在与超级大国代表谈判时保持着完美的尊严
