**Pronunciation:** *xū jīng yī chǎng*  
**Literal meaning:** Empty fright for nothing

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes a false (虚) alarm or scare (惊) that amounts to nothing (一场). The character 场 suggests a theatrical event - the drama that turns out to have no substance. The phrase captures the relief mixed with embarrassment of unnecessary fear. It appeared in Ming Dynasty literature describing dramatic situations resolved harmlessly. Modern usage describes any situation where fear or worry proves unfounded, from medical scares to suspected dangers that turn out to be benign.

## Examples

**English:** "The suspicious package turned out to be harmless - just a false alarm."

**Chinese:** 可疑包裹原来是无害的——虚惊一场。
