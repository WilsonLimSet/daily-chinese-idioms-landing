## Origin & Usage

Combining deep (深) planning (谋) with far-reaching (远) consideration (虑), this idiom emerged from Western Han political philosophy. It appeared in historical accounts praising strategists who could anticipate complex consequences of their actions. The phrase gained prominence during the Three Kingdoms period, where long-term strategic thinking often determined survival. In Song Dynasty governmental practices, it became a crucial criterion for evaluating potential officials, particularly those responsible for infrastructure and defense. The concept significantly influenced Chinese military strategy, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple future scenarios. Contemporary usage emphasizes the value of comprehensive planning and consideration of long-term implications, particularly in business strategy, environmental policy, and personal life planning.
