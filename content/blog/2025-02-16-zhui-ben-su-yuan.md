**Pronunciation:** *zhuī běn sù yuán*  
**Literal meaning:** Chase root trace source

## Origin & Usage

Emerging from Song Dynasty (960-1279) scholarly methodology, this idiom combines the actions of chasing (追) to the root (本) and tracing (溯) to the source (源). It reflected the Neo-Confucian emphasis on understanding phenomena by examining their origins, influenced by Han Dynasty historiographical traditions of tracing historical causation. The water metaphor was particularly meaningful as scholars often compared knowledge to rivers flowing from distant sources. Modern usage spans academic research, problem-solving in business, and personal growth - emphasizing that understanding complex issues requires investigating their fundamental origins rather than just addressing surface manifestations.

## Examples

**English:** "The researcher tracked the problem to its root cause"

**Chinese:** 研究人员追踪到问题的根源
