## Origin & Usage

Ming Dynasty storytellers gave us this sharp critique of those who create their own version of cleverness (自作聪明), often leading to foolish decisions. Qing Dynasty satirists particularly favored it when mocking social climbers and the pretentious. The psychological insight proves remarkably modern - connecting presumed cleverness with actual foolishness through excessive self-regard. Contemporary workplace dynamics still demonstrate how overestimated intelligence leads to counterproductive outcomes when proper consultation is abandoned for presumed superior insight.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The employee implemented unauthorized changes that created technical problems
