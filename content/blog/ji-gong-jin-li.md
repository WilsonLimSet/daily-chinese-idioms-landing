**Pronunciation:** *jí gōng jìn lì*
**Literal meaning:** Rush achievement near profit

## Origin & Usage

Tang Dynasty court critics first used this phrase to condemn officials rushing achievements (急功) for immediate benefits (近利). Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian philosophers expanded it into a broader warning about the dangers of prioritizing speed over proper development. The spatial metaphor of 'near' (近) benefits perfectly captured the shortsightedness of sacrificing lasting value for quick gains. Modern business ethics still wrestles with these same tensions.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The hasty development project prioritized quick returns over quality and sustainability
