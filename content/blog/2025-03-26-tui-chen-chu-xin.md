**Literal meaning:** Push old produce new

## Origin & Usage

Originating in the Classic of Changes (I Ching), this phrase combines the actions of pushing away (推) the old or stale (陈) to bring forth (出) the new (新). During the Spring and Autumn period, it became a principle of scholarly innovation - respecting traditional knowledge while advancing new interpretations. The concept gained particular significance during the Tang Dynasty's intellectual renaissance, where scholars reinterpreted classical texts for contemporary relevance. In modern contexts, it's often invoked in discussions of innovation in technology, arts, and business strategy, emphasizing that true innovation builds upon rather than dismisses tradition.

## Examples

**English:** "The designer combined traditional elements with modern technology"

**Chinese:** 设计师将传统元素与现代技术相结合
