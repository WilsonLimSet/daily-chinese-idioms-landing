**Pronunciation:** *wèi yǔ chóu móu*  
**Literal meaning:** Prepare umbrella before rain

## Origin & Usage

Dating to the Zhou Dynasty's Book of Changes, this idiom literally describes preparing (缪) with silk cords (绸) before (未) the rain (雨) arrives. It originated from the practice of reinforcing buildings during dry seasons to prevent leaks. Ancient carpenters would inspect and repair roof bindings preemptively, as wet conditions made repairs dangerous and ineffective. The wisdom proved valuable beyond construction – during the Tang Dynasty, it became associated with Chancellor Wei Zheng's famous advice about anticipating and preventing problems rather than solving crises. Today, it applies to all forms of proactive planning, from business risk management to personal financial preparation.

## Examples

**English:** "She saved money each month for unexpected expenses"
