**Pronunciation:** *míng qiāng yì duǒ*  
**Literal meaning:** Bright spear easy dodge

## Origin & Usage

In ancient Chinese warfare, a visible (明) spear (枪) was considered easy (易) to dodge (躲). This military wisdom emerged from the Spring and Autumn period, when straightforward attacks were less feared than hidden strategies. The idiom gained prominence through historical chronicles describing how skilled generals preferred subtle tactics over obvious aggression. It parallels Sun Tzu's teachings about the superiority of indirect approaches in The Art of War. In modern contexts, it warns against transparent threats while suggesting that obvious dangers are often less perilous than concealed ones. Commonly used in business negotiations and social dynamics to emphasize that predictable challenges are manageable, while hidden agendas pose greater risks.

## Examples

**English:** "She preferred direct criticism to unspoken disapproval"
