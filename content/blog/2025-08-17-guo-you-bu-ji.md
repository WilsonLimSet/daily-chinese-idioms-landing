**Pronunciation:** *guò yóu bù jí*  
**Literal meaning:** Excess equals deficiency

## Origin & Usage

This balanced idiom states that going too far (过) is just as (犹) problematic as not reaching far enough (不及), originating from Confucius's teachings in the Analects. The concept formed a cornerstone of Confucian moderation philosophy, where extremes in either direction were considered equally flawed. During the Han Dynasty, it became a standard principle in governance, warning officials against both excessive leniency and harshness. The balanced structure of the phrase itself embodied the moderation it advocated. Modern usage advocates appropriate measure in all things, warning against overcompensation or excessive correction, particularly relevant in contexts from business decisions to personal habits where balance rather than extremism yields optimal results.

## Examples

**English:** "The excessive marketing campaign alienated customers instead of attracting them"

**Chinese:** 过度的营销活动疏远了顾客，而不是吸引他们
