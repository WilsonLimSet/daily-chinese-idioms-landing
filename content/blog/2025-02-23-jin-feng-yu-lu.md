**Pronunciation:** *jīn fēng yù lù*  
**Literal meaning:** Golden wind jade dew

## Origin & Usage

This poetic idiom pairs golden (金) autumn wind (风) with jade-like (玉) dew (露), dating from Tang Dynasty nature poetry. It captures the crystalline clarity of fall mornings when the first cool breezes meet with early dew, traditionally considered the most beautiful moments of the year. The combination of precious materials (gold and jade) with natural phenomena created a metaphor for perfect timing and natural harmony. Modern usage often describes ideal moments or perfect conditions, particularly those that arise from natural timing rather than forced arrangement. It appears frequently in literature and art celebrating fleeting moments of natural beauty.
