**Pronunciation:** *hǎi nà bǎi chuān*  
**Literal meaning:** Sea accepts hundred rivers

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes how the sea (海) accepts (纳) a hundred (百) rivers (川), celebrating inclusivity and breadth of mind. It first gained prominence during the Tang Dynasty, reflecting China's cosmopolitan golden age when the capital Chang'an welcomed influences from across Asia. The metaphor draws power from the observation that the sea maintains its nature while accepting countless streams. During the Song Dynasty, Neo-Confucian scholars used it to advocate for intellectual openness while maintaining core principles. Modern usage promotes diversity and open-mindedness in organizational culture, suggesting that true greatness comes from embracing multiple perspectives while maintaining coherent identity.
