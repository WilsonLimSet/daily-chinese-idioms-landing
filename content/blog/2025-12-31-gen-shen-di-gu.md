**Pronunciation:** *gēn shēn dì gù*
**Literal meaning:** Roots deep stem firm

## Origin & Usage

Ancient Chinese farming manuals first observed how plants with deep roots (根深) and firm stems (蒂固) could withstand both storms and drought. Han Dynasty scholars transformed this botanical observation into a metaphor for cultural resilience. The agricultural imagery perfectly captured how invisible foundations determine visible strength. Modern usage describes any practice or belief so thoroughly established that change becomes nearly impossible.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The traditional beliefs remained entrenched in the community despite modernization
