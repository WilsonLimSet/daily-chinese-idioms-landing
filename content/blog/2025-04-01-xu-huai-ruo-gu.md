**Pronunciation:** *xū huái ruò gǔ*  
**Literal meaning:** Empty heart like valley

## Origin & Usage

Derived from Daoist philosophy, this phrase advocates maintaining an empty (虚) heart/mind (怀) like (若) a valley (谷). The valley metaphor was particularly significant in Daoist thought - like a valley that receives all waters without preference, one should remain open to all ideas without prejudice. During the Song Dynasty, it became a crucial principle in Neo-Confucian scholarly discourse. Contemporary usage emphasizes intellectual humility and openness to new ideas, particularly valuable in leadership and learning contexts.

## Examples

**English:** "The professor welcomed new ideas from his students"
