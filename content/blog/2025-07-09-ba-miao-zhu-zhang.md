**Pronunciation:** *bá miáo zhù zhǎng*  
**Literal meaning:** Pull seedlings help growth

## Origin & Usage

This agricultural idiom describes the counterproductive action of pulling up (拔) seedlings (苗) to help (助) their growth (长), originating from Mencius's writings during the Warring States period. He recounted a story of an impatient farmer who, unsatisfied with his seedlings' slow growth, pulled them slightly upward each day, ultimately killing them. The tale emerged from agrarian society where understanding natural growth cycles was essential. During the Han Dynasty, the story became a standard teaching example in governance texts, warning against forced implementation of policies before conditions were ready. Modern usage criticizes well-intentioned but harmful interventions that interrupt natural development processes, particularly relevant in education, parenting, and organizational development.

## Examples

**English:** "The overanxious parent's excessive intervention harmed the child's natural development"

**Chinese:** 过于焦虑的父母过度干预损害了孩子的自然发展
