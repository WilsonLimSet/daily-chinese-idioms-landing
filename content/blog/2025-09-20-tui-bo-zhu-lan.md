**Pronunciation:** *tuī bō zhù lán*  
**Literal meaning:** Push waves, aid ripples

## Origin & Usage

This amplifying idiom describes pushing (推) waves (波) and helping (助) ripples (澜), originating from Southern Dynasty poetry. It initially described how winds intensify natural water movements, creating a powerful metaphor for augmenting existing momentum. During the Tang Dynasty, political commentators adopted it to describe how minor policy adjustments could magnify ongoing social trends. The water imagery was particularly effective as ripples naturally expand from central disturbances. Unlike terms for creating change, it specifically addresses enhancing existing movements. Modern usage describes intentionally adding force to developing situations or trends, particularly strategic interventions that multiply rather than initiate momentum, suggesting that timing contributions to coincide with natural developments often maximizes impact.

## When to Use
