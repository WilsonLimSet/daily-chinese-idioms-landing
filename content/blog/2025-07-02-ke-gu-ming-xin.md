**Pronunciation:** *kè gǔ míng xīn*  
**Literal meaning:** Carve bone inscribe heart

## Origin & Usage

This profound idiom describes experiences so intense they seem carved (刻) into one's bones (骨) and inscribed (铭) in the heart (心), emerging from Han Dynasty ancestral worship practices, where important family events were literally carved into bone tokens for remembrance. The phrase gained emotional resonance through Tang Dynasty poetry, particularly in works describing profound grief or love. The specific pairing of bones (representing physical permanence) with heart (emotional core) emphasized how certain experiences transform both body and spirit. Modern usage describes formative experiences that fundamentally alter one's identity - from profound trauma to transformative love - suggesting memories that remain perpetually vivid and influential.

## Examples
