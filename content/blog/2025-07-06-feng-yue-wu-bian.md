**Pronunciation:** *fēng yuè wú biān*  
**Literal meaning:** Wind moon without boundaries

## Origin & Usage

This aesthetic idiom celebrates how the beauty of wind (风) and moon (月) extends without (无) boundaries (边), originating from Tang Dynasty poetry. It first appeared in verses describing transcendent natural beauty that seemed to expand beyond physical limits. The specific pairing of wind and moon represented the perfect balance of dynamic and serene elements in nature. During the Song Dynasty, it evolved into a broader concept of boundless artistic inspiration. The phrase gained particular significance in Ming Dynasty literary criticism, describing works that evoked infinite emotional resonance beyond their literal content. Modern usage celebrates experiences of boundless beauty or inspiration, suggesting aesthetic appreciation that transcends ordinary limitations.
