## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes orderliness like a well (井然) with proper sequence (有序). The well metaphor relates to the grid pattern of ancient Chinese field systems where wells marked intersections. This regular pattern represented ideal organization. The phrase appeared in texts praising well-administered territories. Modern usage describes anything arranged systematically and neatly, from physical spaces to administrative systems to personal schedules.
