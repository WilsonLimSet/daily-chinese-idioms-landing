**Pronunciation:** *běn mò dào zhì*  
**Literal meaning:** Root branch reversed position

## Origin & Usage

This organizational idiom criticizes reversing (倒置) the proper order of root/fundamental (本) and branch/peripheral matters (末), originating from Han Dynasty governance texts. It first appeared in discussions about administrative priorities, warning officials against focusing on secondary issues while neglecting primary ones. The botanical metaphor drew from agricultural wisdom that roots must be nourished before branches. During the Song Dynasty, it became a standard critique in policy debates about resource allocation. Unlike terms for simple disorder, it specifically addresses hierarchy and priority rather than mere sequence. Modern usage criticizes misplaced emphasis in any context - from business strategy to personal time management - where attention to minor details overshadows more consequential matters.

## Examples

**English:** "The project focused on minor details while neglecting the core objectives"

**Chinese:** 项目专注于次要细节，而忽视了核心目标
