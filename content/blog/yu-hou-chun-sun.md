**Pronunciation:** *yǔ hòu chūn sǔn*  
**Literal meaning:** Bamboo shoots after spring rain

## Origin & Usage

This idiom captures the natural phenomenon of bamboo shoots (春笋) growing rapidly after (后) spring rain (雨). In Chinese landscapes, bamboo groves visibly transform after rainfall as countless new shoots emerge almost overnight. The phrase first appeared in Song Dynasty texts describing rapid multiplication of phenomena. It emphasizes both speed and abundance, suggesting organic, natural growth rather than forced development. Modern usage commonly describes rapid emergence of new businesses, trends, buildings, or any phenomenon proliferating quickly.

## Examples

**English:** "Tech startups are emerging rapidly like bamboo shoots after rain."

**Chinese:** 科技初创公司如雨后春笋般涌现。
