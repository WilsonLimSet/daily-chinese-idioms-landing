**Pronunciation:** *nán xiōng nán dì*  
**Literal meaning:** Difficult elder and younger brothers

## Origin & Usage

This related idiom describes troubled (难) elder brother (兄) and troubled (难) younger brother (弟), originating from Qing Dynasty vernacular literature. It described families where siblings shared similar difficulties or misfortunes. The repetition of '难' (difficult) emphasized their common predicament, while the brother terms reflected the Confucian emphasis on fraternal relationships. During the Republican era, it expanded beyond blood relationships to describe any pair facing similar challenges. Unlike terms for simple partnership, it specifically emphasizes shared hardship as the bonding element. Modern usage describes companions in misfortune or associates connected through similar struggles, suggesting that shared difficulties often create stronger bonds than shared advantages.
