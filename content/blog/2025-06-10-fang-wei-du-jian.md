**Pronunciation:** *fáng wēi dù jiàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Prevent small stop gradual

## Origin & Usage

This proactive idiom advocates preventing (防) minor problems (微) and blocking (杜) their gradual (渐) development, first appearing in Han Dynasty governance manuals. It gained prominence during the Tang Dynasty through Chancellor Wei Zheng's famous memorial warning Emperor Taizong that small issues eventually become unmanageable if neglected. The concept significantly influenced Chinese medicine, where doctors emphasized treating subtle symptoms before they manifested as serious illness. Historical texts record how hydraulic engineers applied this principle to river management, repairing minor dike weaknesses to prevent catastrophic floods. Modern applications range from risk management to relationship maintenance, emphasizing early intervention as both more effective and less costly than addressing developed problems.

## Examples

**English:** "The company implemented strict compliance measures to prevent potential violations"

**Chinese:** 公司实施了严格的合规措施，以防微杜渐
