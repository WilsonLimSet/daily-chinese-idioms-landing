**Pronunciation:** *xǔ xǔ rú shēng*  
**Literal meaning:** Vividly as if alive

## Origin & Usage

This idiom uses the reduplicated 'xuxu' (栩栩), meaning vivid or lifelike, combined with 'as if alive' (如生) to describe art so realistic it appears living. The character 栩 originally referred to oak trees and their vibrant appearance. The phrase emerged from art criticism during the Han Dynasty, praising works that transcended mere representation to capture the essence of life. It embodies the Chinese aesthetic ideal of art that conveys spirit (神) rather than just form. Modern usage praises exceptionally realistic art, writing, or performance.

## Examples

**English:** "The sculptor's work was so realistic it seemed ready to move."

**Chinese:** 雕塑家的作品栩栩如生，仿佛随时会动起来。
