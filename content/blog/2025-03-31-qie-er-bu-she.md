**Literal meaning:** Carve and not stop

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from the story of an ancient man who attempted to carve (锲) through a mountain with unwavering persistence (不舍). Recorded in pre-Qin texts, it exemplifies the classical Chinese virtue of perseverance through seemingly impossible tasks. The character 锲 specifically refers to carving jade - a process requiring both strength and delicacy. Modern usage emphasizes persistent effort toward goals, particularly in contexts requiring both determination and careful attention to detail.
