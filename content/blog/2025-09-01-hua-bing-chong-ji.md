**Pronunciation:** *huà bǐng chōng jī*  
**Literal meaning:** Draw cakes to alleviate hunger

## Origin & Usage

This illusory idiom describes drawing (画) cakes (饼) to satisfy (充) hunger (饥), originating from Jin Dynasty Buddhist parables. It first appeared in teachings illustrating how illusions cannot satisfy material needs, regardless of how appealing they might appear. During the Tang Dynasty, it expanded beyond religious contexts to describe political promises without substantive action. The food imagery created a powerful metaphor for attempting to address physical needs with mere representations. Modern usage criticizes offering insubstantial substitutes for genuine solutions, particularly empty promises or theoretical proposals in place of concrete actions, teaching that symbolic gestures prove inadequate when addressing fundamental needs.

## Examples

**English:** "The company offered empty promises instead of actual raises"

**Chinese:** 公司提供空洞的承诺而不是实际的加薪
