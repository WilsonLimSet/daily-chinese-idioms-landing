**Pronunciation:** *dōng shī xiào pín*  
**Literal meaning:** Dongshi imitates Xishi's frown

## Origin & Usage

This misguided idiom describes how Dongshi (东施), an ugly woman, imitated the frown (效颦) of Xishi, a legendary beauty, originating from Taoist text 'Zhuangzi' during the Warring States period. When beautiful Xishi frowned while suffering heart pain, it enhanced her beauty; when Dongshi imitated without understanding the context, she repelled villagers. The story gained prominence during the Han Dynasty as a caution against superficial imitation. Unlike terms for simple copying, it specifically addresses imitating external form without understanding essence or context. Modern usage criticizes blind imitation that fails because the imitator doesn't understand the underlying principles or lacks the inherent qualities that made the original successful.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The new restaurant awkwardly copied successful establishments without understanding their appeal
