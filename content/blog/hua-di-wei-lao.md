**Pronunciation:** *huà dì wéi láo*  
**Literal meaning:** Drawing ground as prison

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from 'Records of the Grand Historian' (史记), describing ancient punishment where criminals were confined to a circle drawn on the ground, honoring the boundary as if it were prison walls. The story illustrates how social trust and honor could substitute for physical restraints. The phrase has evolved to describe self-imposed limitations, where people restrict themselves within imaginary boundaries. Modern usage warns against creating unnecessary mental barriers that limit one's potential and opportunities.

## Examples

**English:** "Don't limit yourself by drawing boundaries that don't exist."

**Chinese:** 不要画地为牢，限制自己的发展。
