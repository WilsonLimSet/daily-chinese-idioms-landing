**Pronunciation:** *jǐng dǐ zhī wā*  
**Literal meaning:** Frog at well bottom

## Origin & Usage

This limited idiom describes a frog (蛙) living at the bottom (底) of a well (井), originating from the Warring States period text 'Zhuangzi.' It tells of a frog who believed its well contained the whole world, until a sea turtle described the immensity of the ocean, revealing the frog's provincial perspective. The well created a perfect metaphor for restricted experience leading to restricted understanding. During the Han Dynasty, the story became a standard criticism of intellectual narrowness from limited exposure. Unlike terms for simple ignorance, it specifically addresses how environmental constraints shape perception. Modern usage criticizes narrow-mindedness resulting from limited experience, particularly in contexts requiring global or comprehensive understanding.

## Examples

**English:** "Having never worked abroad, the manager's perspective on global markets was severely limited"

**Chinese:** 从未在国外工作过，这位经理对全球市场的看法非常有限
