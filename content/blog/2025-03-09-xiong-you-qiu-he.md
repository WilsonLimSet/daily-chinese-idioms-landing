**Pronunciation:** *xiōng yǒu qiū hè*  
**Literal meaning:** Hills and valleys in heart

## Origin & Usage

First appearing in Tang Dynasty literary criticism, this phrase describes having hills (丘) and valleys (壑) within one's heart/mind (胸). It originated from descriptions of landscape painters who could visualize entire scenes before touching brush to paper. The metaphor suggests a rich internal landscape of knowledge and imagination, shaped by both study and contemplation. This idea influenced the development of Chinese artistic theory, particularly the concept that true mastery requires internal cultivation before external expression. Contemporary usage describes deep expertise or sophisticated understanding, especially in creative or strategic fields.

## Examples

**English:** "The architect had a clear vision for the city's transformation"
