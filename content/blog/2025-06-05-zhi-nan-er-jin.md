**Pronunciation:** *zhī nán ér jìn*  
**Literal meaning:** Know difficulty yet advance

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes the courage to recognize (知) difficulties (难) and still move forward (进), originating from Warring States military strategy texts. It first gained prominence through the story of General Wu Qi, who famously told his king that understanding battlefield challenges before engaging showed true courage. The concept gained renewed significance during the Northern Song Dynasty when reformer Wang Anshi used it to justify ambitious governmental changes. Unlike blind optimism, it celebrates clear-eyed determination that acknowledges obstacles while committing to overcome them. Modern applications span from entrepreneurship to personal development, emphasizing how informed perseverance differs from naive enthusiasm or reckless bravery.

## Examples
