**Pronunciation:** *bǎi sī bù jiě*  
**Literal meaning:** Think a hundred times still not understand

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes thinking (思) a hundred times (百) yet still not (不) understanding (解), expressing puzzlement that persists despite extensive contemplation. The number 'hundred' suggests numerous attempts rather than a literal count. The phrase emerged in literary contexts describing mysteries and paradoxes that resist rational explanation. It captures the frustration of encountering something genuinely incomprehensible. Modern usage describes confusion about decisions, behaviors, or events that defy logical explanation.

## Examples

**English:** "No matter how much she thought about it, she couldn't understand his decision."

**Chinese:** 无论她怎么想，都对他的决定百思不解。
