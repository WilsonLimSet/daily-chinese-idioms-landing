## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from Tang Dynasty social terminology, first appearing in poetry describing fleeting encounters that created recognition without depth. During the Song Dynasty, scholars used it to categorize their extensive social networks by intimacy levels. The metaphor of seeing only half a face (半面) worth of interaction (之交) was particularly effective—partially glimpsed features suggest recognition without revealing complete character or emotions. Unlike terms simply meaning 'stranger,' it specifically identifies the intermediate relationship stage beyond anonymity but before genuine connection. Modern usage spans networking contexts to social media connections, describing relationships with sufficient recognition for acknowledgment but insufficient depth for meaningful trust or intimacy, particularly in professional contexts where extensive weak ties complement fewer strong relationships.

## When to Use

**Situation:** They had only met briefly at conferences and weren't close enough for personal favors
