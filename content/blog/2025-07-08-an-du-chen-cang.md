**Pronunciation:** *àn dù chén cāng*  
**Literal meaning:** Secretly cross Chencang

## Origin & Usage

This strategic idiom refers to secretly (暗) crossing/passing (度) through Chencang (陈仓), originating from Han Xin's famous military maneuver during the Chu-Han contention (206-202 BCE). Historical records describe how Han Xin pretended to repair roads in one location while secretly moving troops through Chencang, enabling a surprise attack. The city name itself became synonymous with strategic misdirection through this incident. During the Tang Dynasty, it evolved beyond military contexts to describe any successful deception through distraction. Modern usage describes achieving objectives through misdirection rather than confrontation, particularly in business competition or negotiation strategies, where creating false impressions about one's intentions provides tactical advantage.

## Examples

**English:** "The company quietly developed the technology while competitors focused elsewhere"

**Chinese:** 当竞争对手将注意力集中在其他地方时，该公司悄悄地开发了这项技术
