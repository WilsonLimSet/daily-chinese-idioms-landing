**Pronunciation:** *ǒu xīn lì xuè*  
**Literal meaning:** Vomit heart drip blood

## Origin & Usage

This visceral idiom describes effort so intense it's like vomiting (呕) one's heart (心) and dripping (沥) blood (血), first appearing in Tang Dynasty literary criticism. It originally described the suffering of poets who created through intense emotional labor. Scholar Han Yu used it to explain how great writing emerges from profound internal struggle. During the Song Dynasty, it expanded beyond literary contexts to describe any work requiring extreme dedication and personal sacrifice. Unlike idioms describing external obstacles, it focuses on the internal toll of creation or achievement. Modern usage honors those who invest themselves completely in their work, particularly in artistic and intellectual pursuits requiring emotional authenticity and complete commitment.

## Examples

**English:** "The author poured her deepest emotions into the novel"
