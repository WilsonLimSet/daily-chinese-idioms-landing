**Pronunciation:** *gǎi xié guī zhèng*  
**Literal meaning:** Turn from wrong return to right

## Origin & Usage

Emerging from Buddhist texts during the Eastern Han Dynasty, this idiom describes the journey of turning away (改) from wrong (邪) to return (归) to righteousness (正). The metaphor draws from astronomical observations where wandering stars return to their proper paths. It gained prominence during the Tang Dynasty as Buddhism spread throughout China, offering a compassionate view of moral reformation. The concept resonated with Confucian scholars who saw moral cultivation as a continuous process of correction and improvement. Modern usage emphasizes the possibility of redemption and positive change, particularly in rehabilitation contexts. It suggests that ethical transformation requires both active rejection of harmful behaviors and conscious embrace of positive principles.
