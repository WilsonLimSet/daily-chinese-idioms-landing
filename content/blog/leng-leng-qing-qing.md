**Pronunciation:** *lěng lěng qīng qīng*
**Literal meaning:** Cold cold quiet quiet

## Origin & Usage

Song Dynasty poets coined this atmospheric phrase combining coldness (冷冷) with quietness (清清) to describe abandoned places. Their verses painted pictures of once-bustling temples and palaces now standing empty. Ming Dynasty writers adopted it to establish lonely settings in their stories. The doubled characters intensify both the thermal and auditory dimensions of absence, creating a more profound sense of emptiness than either quality alone could convey.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The once-bustling shopping mall now stood eerily deserted
