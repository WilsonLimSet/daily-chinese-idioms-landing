The repetition of 'one' (一) with 'heart' (心) and 'mind/intention' (意) emphasizes complete unity of purpose and concentration. The phrase gained broader usage in describing devotion in any endeavor. It represents the ideal state of undivided attention and commitment, whether in spiritual practice, work, or relationships.
