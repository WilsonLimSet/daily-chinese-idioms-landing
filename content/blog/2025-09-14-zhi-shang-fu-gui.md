**Pronunciation:** *zhǐ shàng fù guì*  
**Literal meaning:** Wealth on paper only

## Origin & Usage

This illusory idiom describes wealth and status (富贵) existing only on paper (纸上), originating from Ming Dynasty commercial critiques. It first described merchants who maintained elaborate account books showing theoretical profits while actually struggling financially. The specific reference to paper connected to both accounting records and the examination system, where scholastic achievement on paper didn't always translate to practical capability. During the Qing Dynasty, it expanded to describe any disconnection between documented prosperity and actual circumstances. Modern usage identifies situations where theoretical or reported success masks actual performance issues, particularly in business and professional contexts where impressive documentation often substitutes for genuine accomplishment.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The entrepreneur's business looked impressive in presentations but generated little actual revenue
