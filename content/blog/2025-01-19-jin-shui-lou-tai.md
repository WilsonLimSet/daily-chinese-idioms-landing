**Pronunciation:** *jìn shuǐ lóu tái*  
**Literal meaning:** Pavilion close to water

## Origin & Usage

First appearing in Tang Dynasty poetry, this idiom describes pavilions (楼台) close (近) to water (水), referring to their advantageous position to catch the moon's reflection first. The phrase gained wider usage during the Song Dynasty as a metaphor for privileged access or favorable positioning. Originally describing the literal beauty of waterside architecture, it evolved to represent the benefits of proximity to power or resources. During the Ming Dynasty, it became associated with political networking and family connections in the imperial examination system. Modern usage often describes advantageous relationships or positioning in business and social contexts, acknowledging that opportunity often depends on access and location.
