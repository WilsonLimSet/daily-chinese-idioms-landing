**Pronunciation:** *yī sī bù gǒu*  
**Literal meaning:** Not loose one thread

## Origin & Usage

This meticulous idiom literally means not allowing a single (一) silk thread (丝) to be careless (不苟). Emerging from textile craftsmanship during the Song Dynasty, it originally described the precise attention required in silk weaving, where a single loose thread could compromise an entire piece. The phrase exemplifies the Chinese cultural value of perfectionism in craftsmanship. Modern usage applies to any task requiring extreme precision and attention to detail, from scientific research to artistic creation, emphasizing thoroughness and an uncompromising commitment to quality.
