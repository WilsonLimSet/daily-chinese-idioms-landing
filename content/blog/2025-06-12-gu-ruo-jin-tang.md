**Pronunciation:** *gù ruò jīn tāng*  
**Literal meaning:** Solid as metal soup

## Origin & Usage

This military metaphor describes defenses firm (固) as (若) metal (金) and hot moat water (汤), originating from Han Dynasty fortress construction, where metal gates and boiling water were ultimate defensive measures. The phrase first appeared in military texts describing the ideal fortification combining both passive and active defenses. During the Three Kingdoms period, it gained prominence through descriptions of Zhuge Liang's defensive installations. The specific pairing of metal (immovable, impenetrable) with boiling water (active, dangerous) created a perfect image of comprehensive security. Modern usage describes any system designed with multiple robust protective layers, from cybersecurity protocols to legal agreements.

## Examples

**English:** "The company's cybersecurity defenses were impenetrable to attackers"

**Chinese:** 公司的网络安全防御对攻击者来说固若金汤
