**Pronunciation:** *hài qún zhī mǎ*
**Literal meaning:** Harm herd's horse

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty horse breeders first noted how a single problematic horse (马) could harm (害) an entire herd (群). Tang Dynasty administrators adopted it to describe how one disruptive official could damage entire departments. The agricultural observation proved universally applicable - groups dependent on coordination remain particularly vulnerable to individual disruptive elements.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The employee's repeated violations damaged team morale and productivity
