**Pronunciation:** *yù sù bù dá*  
**Literal meaning:** Desire speed, not reach

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes desiring (欲) speed (速) but not (不) reaching (达) the goal. From the Analects where Confucius warned that haste impedes rather than helps. The phrase captures the paradox that rushing often slows progress. Modern usage warns against impatience, recognizing that sustainable achievement requires appropriate pacing rather than desperate rushing.

## Examples

**English:** "Rushing the project caused more delays in the end."

**Chinese:** 赶工反而导致了更多延误，真是欲速不达。
