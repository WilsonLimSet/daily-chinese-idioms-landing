**Pronunciation:** *shuǐ dào qú chéng*  
**Literal meaning:** Water comes channel forms

## Origin & Usage

Drawing from ancient Chinese irrigation practices, this idiom captures how water (水) flowing consistently will naturally create its channel (渠). First appearing in Tang Dynasty agricultural texts, it reflected the observation that steady water flow would eventually carve its path through even the hardest terrain. The metaphor resonated deeply with Daoist philosophy about natural progression and minimal intervention. In contemporary usage, it describes how persistent effort, like flowing water, naturally creates pathways to success. The idiom particularly gained relevance during China's massive irrigation projects, reinforcing how patient, consistent action accomplishes more than forceful intervention.
