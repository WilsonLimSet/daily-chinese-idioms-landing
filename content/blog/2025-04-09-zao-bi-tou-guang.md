**Pronunciation:** *záo bì tōu guāng*  
**Literal meaning:** Pierce wall steal light

## Origin & Usage

The story of Kuang Heng, who pierced (凿) his wall (壁) to steal (偷) light (光) from his neighbor's lamp for studying, emerged during the Han Dynasty and was recorded in official histories. Too poor to afford oil for his own lamp, his determination to study despite poverty inspired generations of students. The image of borrowed lamplight streaming through a hole in the wall became a powerful symbol of pursuing education despite material constraints. During the Song Dynasty, when social mobility through education reached new heights, this idiom gained particular significance in encouraging poor scholars. Modern usage often describes students or entrepreneurs who succeed despite resource limitations, emphasizing creativity and determination in overcoming socioeconomic obstacles.

## Examples

**English:** "The student studied by streetlight when electricity was unavailable"
