## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from military contexts in the Han Dynasty, describing generals capable of independently (独) managing (当) one front or flank (一面) of battle. The phrase recognized the rare ability to take full responsibility for a significant area without supervision. It evolved to praise anyone capable of handling substantial responsibility independently. Modern usage commonly describes professionals who have matured to the point of managing projects, departments, or situations without requiring guidance.
