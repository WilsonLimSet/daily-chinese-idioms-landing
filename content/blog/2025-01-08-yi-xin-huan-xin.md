**Pronunciation:** *yǐ xīn huàn xīn*  
**Literal meaning:** Exchange heart for heart

## Origin & Usage

This idiom emerged during the Han Dynasty, expressing the profound concept of exchanging (换) one heart (心) for another (以). It first appeared in diplomatic texts describing the ideal approach to building trust between warring states. The repetition of '心' (heart) emphasizes genuine reciprocity rather than mere transaction. During the Tang Dynasty, Buddhist influences enriched its meaning with concepts of empathy and compassionate understanding. The idiom gained particular significance in medical ethics during the Song Dynasty, where it described the ideal doctor-patient relationship. Modern usage extends to various professional and personal contexts, emphasizing genuine empathy and reciprocal understanding as the foundation of meaningful relationships.
