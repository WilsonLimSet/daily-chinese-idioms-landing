**Pronunciation:** *shǒu zhū dài tù*  
**Literal meaning:** Guard tree wait rabbit

## Origin & Usage

This Warring States period parable tells of a farmer who, after seeing a rabbit die by running into a tree stump (株), waited (待) endlessly for more rabbits (兔) at the same spot. His guard (守) of the stump became a classic example of misguided persistence and inflexible thinking. The story appeared in various philosophical texts as a warning against relying on chance success rather than adaptable strategy. Today, it cautions against rigid methodologies and the failure to evolve strategies with changing circumstances.

## Examples

**English:** "Instead of developing new skills, he just waited for promotions to come"

**Chinese:** 他没有提升技能，只是等待升职机会
