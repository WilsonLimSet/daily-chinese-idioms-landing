## Origin & Usage

Found in the historical records of the Jin Dynasty, this expression of renewed connection (再接) and repeated encouragement (再厉) originally described military commanders maintaining momentum after initial victories. Song Dynasty educators adopted it to motivate students facing imperial examinations, emphasizing the importance of sustained effort after partial success. The doubled character '再' (again) reinforces the concept of renewed commitment. Modern usage spans from athletic training to professional development, urging continued effort when complacency threatens.
