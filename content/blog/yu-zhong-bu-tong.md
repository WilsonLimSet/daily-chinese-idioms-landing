## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes being different (不同) from (与) the crowd (众). It can express either positive uniqueness or critical isolation, depending on context. The phrase appeared in texts discussing individuals who stood apart from conventional society. Chinese culture traditionally valued conformity, making standing out ambivalent. Modern usage often celebrates individuality and uniqueness, though it can still describe being out of step with peers.
