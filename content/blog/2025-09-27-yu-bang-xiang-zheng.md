**Literal meaning:** Snipe clam mutual fight

## Origin & Usage

This cautionary tale depicts a snipe (鹬) and clam (蚌) in mutual (相) combat (争), originating from the 'Strategies of the Warring States' around 300 BCE. During the Han Dynasty, political advisors frequently cited it to warn rulers about the dangers of becoming obsessed with immediate opponents while ignoring larger threats. The animal imagery resonated deeply in Chinese strategic thought, where natural behaviors often illustrated human folly. Modern usage spans from business competition to international relations, warning how mutual antagonism can blind opponents to emerging threats.

## When to Use

**Situation:** While the two companies were locked in legal battles, a third competitor captured their market share
