**Pronunciation:** *gū xī yǎng jiān*  
**Literal meaning:** Tolerate evil, nurture harm

## Origin & Usage

This enabling idiom describes temporarily tolerating (姑息) problems and thereby nurturing (养) future harm (奸), originating from Han Dynasty governmental warnings. It first appeared in administrative texts cautioning against short-term appeasement of problems that would grow more serious if not properly addressed. During the Tang Dynasty, historical chronicles used it to analyze failed policies that initially seemed merciful but ultimately proved destructive. The agricultural metaphor of nurturing (normally positive) applied to harmful elements created a powerful image of unintended consequences. Modern usage criticizes excessive tolerance or accommodation of negative behaviors, particularly when leniency toward minor infractions encourages progression to more serious violations, teaching that appropriate intervention often proves kinder than permissiveness.

## Examples

**English:** "The principal's leniency toward bullying only emboldened the perpetrators"

**Chinese:** 校长对欺凌行为的宽容只会使行为人更加胆大妄为
