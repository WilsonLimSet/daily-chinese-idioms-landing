**Pronunciation:** *yán bù yóu zhōng*  
**Literal meaning:** Words not from heart

## Origin & Usage

First appearing in Han Dynasty court records, this idiom describes words (言) not originating (不由) from within one's heart (衷). It gained particular significance during the Tang Dynasty when court intrigue made distinguishing sincere from insincere speech crucial for survival. Historical accounts tell of ministers using this phrase to warn emperors about flattering but false reports. The concept became central to Confucian discussions of moral character, where alignment between speech and inner feeling was considered essential for virtue. Modern usage often describes diplomatic niceties or corporate communications where public statements may not reflect private thoughts.

## Examples

**English:** "His praise felt empty because it didn't match his actions"

**Chinese:** 他的赞美感觉空洞，因为与他的行动不符
