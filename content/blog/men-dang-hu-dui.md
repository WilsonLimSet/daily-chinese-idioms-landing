## Origin & Usage

Tang Dynasty marriage arrangers first used this architectural metaphor of matching doors (门) and households (户) to describe suitable unions. Family genealogies document how door sizes literally reflected social status, making the metaphor particularly apt. Song Dynasty matchmakers developed it into a systematic principle for arranging marriages between social equals. Today it extends beyond marriage into business partnerships, suggesting that balanced relationships are built on similar social and economic foundations.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Both families had similar social standing, making the marriage alliance advantageous
