**Pronunciation:** *rú shǔ jiā zhēn*  
**Literal meaning:** Count like family treasures

## Origin & Usage

This idiom captures the intimate knowledge of counting (数) family (家) treasures (珍) with perfect familiarity. It originated from descriptions of merchant families during the Song Dynasty, who knew their inventory in precise detail. The metaphor gained broader cultural significance as scholars applied it to mastery of classical texts. Historical accounts show how this level of familiarity marked true expertise in traditional Chinese education. Contemporary usage describes comprehensive knowledge of any subject, suggesting both depth of understanding and personal investment. It implies that true mastery comes from treating knowledge as precious as family heirlooms.
