**Pronunciation:** *gè dé qí suǒ*  
**Literal meaning:** Each finds its place

## Origin & Usage

Emerging from early Confucian texts discussing social harmony, this concept describes how each (各) element finds (得) its proper (其) place (所). The idea gained practical application during the Han Dynasty's civil service reforms, where officials sought to match talents with appropriate roles. Historical records praise administrators who could achieve this balance, creating stable and prosperous regions. The phrase appears in classical garden design texts, describing how every rock and plant should find its natural position. Modern usage extends to organizational management and social policy, suggesting that harmony comes from allowing each component to fulfill its natural function.

## Examples

**English:** "The reorganization helped each team member find their ideal role"

**Chinese:** 重组帮助每个团队成员找到了最适合的角色
