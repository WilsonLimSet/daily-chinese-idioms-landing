**Pronunciation:** *guā mù xiāng kàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Scrape eyes look anew

## Origin & Usage

This perceptive idiom suggests scraping (刮) one's eyes (目) to view (看) someone differently (相), originating from a Three Kingdoms period interaction between strategists. Historical records recount how Lu Meng significantly improved his knowledge, prompting Sun Quan to remark that one would need to 'scrape one's eyes' to see him anew. The vivid image suggested clearing away previous perceptions like removing a film from the eyes. During the Tang Dynasty, it became a standard reference for recognizing someone's dramatically improved abilities. Unlike terms for simple reassessment, it specifically describes positive reappraisal following significant development. Modern usage encourages recognizing others' growth and improvement rather than maintaining outdated assessments, particularly regarding individuals previously underestimated.

## Examples
