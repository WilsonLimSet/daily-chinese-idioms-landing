**Pronunciation:** *tán huā yī xiàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Night flower appears once

## Origin & Usage

This botanical idiom refers to the epiphyllum or night-blooming cereus (昙花) that appears/blooms (现) just once (一) briefly, originating from Buddhist texts of the Tang Dynasty. Monks used this rare flower, which blooms for a single night before wilting, as a metaphor for the impermanence of worldly phenomena. The image gained poetic resonance during the Song Dynasty, appearing in verses about fleeting moments of beauty or opportunity. The specific botanical reference was meaningful as this flower was treasured precisely because of its transience. Modern usage describes any brief but remarkable appearance - from short-lived celebrities to temporary business success - emphasizing both the intensity and brevity of the phenomenon.

## Examples

**English:** "The young artist gained brief fame before disappearing from public view"
