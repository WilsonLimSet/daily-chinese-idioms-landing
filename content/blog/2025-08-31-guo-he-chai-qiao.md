**Pronunciation:** *guò hé chāi qiáo*  
**Literal meaning:** Cross river, dismantle bridge

## Origin & Usage

This ungrateful idiom describes crossing (过) a river (河) and then dismantling (拆) the bridge (桥), originating from Tang Dynasty political commentary. It first described officials who abandoned supporters after achieving power. The bridge metaphor was particularly resonant in ancient China, where river crossings represented crucial transition points often requiring community cooperation to build and maintain. During the Song Dynasty, historical chronicles used it to criticize rulers who neglected foundational allies after consolidating power. Modern usage condemns discarding relationships, tools, or methods immediately after they've served their purpose, particularly instances of ingratitude toward those who provided essential assistance during difficult transitions.

## Examples

**English:** "After securing the promotion, she quickly abandoned the colleagues who had supported her"
