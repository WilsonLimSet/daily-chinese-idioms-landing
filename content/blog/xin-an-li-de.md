## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes the heart (心) being at peace (安) because reason (理) is satisfied (得). It describes the inner tranquility that comes from knowing one has acted correctly. The phrase connects moral behavior with psychological well-being. Modern usage describes the peace of mind that follows ethical actions, or sometimes sarcastically, those who feel unjustifiably content with questionable behavior.
