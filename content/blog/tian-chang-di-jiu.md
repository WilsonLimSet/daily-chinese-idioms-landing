**Pronunciation:** *tiān cháng dì jiǔ*
**Literal meaning:** Heaven is long, earth is lasting

## Origin & Usage

This idiom derives from Chapter 7 of the Daoist classic 'Tao Te Ching' (道德经) by Laozi: 'Heaven and earth are long-lasting.' The phrase uses the eternal nature of heaven (天) and earth (地) as metaphors for permanence and durability. It gained romantic connotations through Tang Dynasty poetry, particularly Bai Juyi's 'Song of Everlasting Sorrow' where it describes enduring love. The idiom is commonly used in wedding blessings and expressions of lasting relationships, though it can apply to any bond or commitment meant to endure through time.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Their friendship proved to be as enduring as heaven and earth.
