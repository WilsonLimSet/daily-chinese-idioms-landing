**Pronunciation:** *mù bù zhuǎn jīng*  
**Literal meaning:** Eyes do not turn away

## Origin & Usage

This vivid description of eyes (目) that don't (不) turn (转) their gaze (睛) originates from Han Dynasty descriptions of intense focus. The phrase first appeared in historical accounts of scholars so absorbed in their studies that they remained oblivious to their surroundings. During the Song Dynasty, it became associated with the ideal learning state. The concept gained additional significance in traditional Chinese painting theory, describing the intense observation required to capture a subject's essence. In Ming Dynasty military texts, it described the unwavering attention needed by archers and strategists. Modern usage extends beyond literal focus to describe any state of complete absorption or concentration, particularly in contexts requiring sustained attention, from surgical procedures to artistic creation.

## Examples

**English:** "The surgeon performed the delicate procedure with complete concentration"

**Chinese:** 外科医生全神贯注地进行着精密手术
