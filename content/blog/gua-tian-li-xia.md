**Literal meaning:** Melon field plum under

## Origin & Usage

The 'Book of Rites' first warned against adjusting shoes in melon fields (瓜田) or hats under plum trees (李下), as these innocent actions could be misinterpreted as preparation for theft. Tang Dynasty writers expanded it beyond specific locations to any situation inviting misinterpretation. The agricultural settings provided concrete examples of how context can make innocent actions appear suspicious. Modern professional ethics still emphasizes avoiding not just impropriety but even its appearance.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The professor avoided meeting alone with students to prevent any appearance of impropriety
