## Origin & Usage

This ironic tale tells of Lord Ye (叶公) who professed to love (好) dragons (龙) but fled in terror when faced with a real one. During the Six Dynasties period, it became a standard criticism of superficial appreciation without genuine understanding. The dragon imagery carried particular weight in Chinese culture, where these creatures represented divine power and blessing. Modern usage describes the gap between theoretical support and practical commitment - from executives who praise innovation but reject new ideas, to reformers who retreat when facing real change.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The executive claimed to value innovation but rejected every new idea presented
