**Pronunciation:** *yì xiǎng bù dào*  
**Literal meaning:** Mind imagines not reaching

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes something that one's thoughts (意想) could not (不) reach or anticipate (到). The phrase emphasizes the limits of imagination when confronted with surprising reality. It emerged in vernacular literature during the Ming Dynasty to describe plot twists and unexpected events. The structure suggests that what occurred was beyond the boundaries of what could reasonably be imagined. Modern usage commonly describes surprises, unexpected developments, or outcomes that defied all predictions.

## Examples

**English:** "The plot twist was completely unexpected."

**Chinese:** 剧情的反转完全意想不到。
