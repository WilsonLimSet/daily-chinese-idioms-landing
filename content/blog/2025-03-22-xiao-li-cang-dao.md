**Pronunciation:** *xiào lǐ cáng dāo*  
**Literal meaning:** Hide knife in smile

## Origin & Usage

This chilling idiom describes hiding a knife (刀) within a smile (笑), originating from historical accounts of court intrigue during the Late Han period. It gained prominence through stories of strategic advisors who maintained friendly appearances while plotting against rivals. The contrast between the warm smile and concealed weapon (藏) created a powerful image of deception. Modern usage describes hidden malicious intent behind friendly facades, particularly relevant in business and political contexts where surface cordiality may mask hostile intentions.

## Examples

**English:** "His friendly investment advice concealed a fraudulent scheme"

**Chinese:** 他友好的投资建议掩盖着诈骗计划
