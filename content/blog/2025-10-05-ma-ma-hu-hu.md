**Pronunciation:** *mǎ mǎ hǔ hǔ*
**Literal meaning:** Horse horse tiger tiger

## Origin & Usage

This moderate assessment idiom, literally 'horse (马) horse tiger (虎) tiger,' emerged from a folk tale about a careless artist whose painting was neither clearly a horse nor a tiger. During the Qing Dynasty, it appeared in vernacular literature describing casual or imprecise work. The repeating animals - both powerful creatures in Chinese culture - create an ironic contrast where their combination produces mediocrity rather than excellence. Modern usage describes acceptable but unmemorable performance across various contexts, expressing a particularly Chinese cultural tolerance for the passable middle ground.

## When to Use

**Situation:** His performance in the presentation was just passable, neither impressive nor terrible
