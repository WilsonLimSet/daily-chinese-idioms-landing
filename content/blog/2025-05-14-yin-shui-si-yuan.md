**Pronunciation:** *yǐn shuǐ sī yuán*  
**Literal meaning:** Drink water think source

## Origin & Usage

This reflection on gratitude emerged during the Tang Dynasty, using the everyday act of drinking (饮) water (水) to remind one to think (思) of its source (源). The idiom gained prominence through Buddhist texts that emphasized mindful appreciation of life's foundations. It was particularly meaningful in agricultural communities where water sources determined settlement patterns and community bonds. In imperial China, it became associated with remembering one's teachers and benefactors. Modern usage extends beyond literal gratitude for resources to encompass appreciation for opportunities, education, and support systems. It serves as a reminder that success is rarely purely individual, encouraging acknowledgment of those who contributed to one's achievements.
