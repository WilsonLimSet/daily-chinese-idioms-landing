**Pronunciation:** *dǎn dà xīn xì*  
**Literal meaning:** Bold gallbladder, careful heart

## Origin & Usage

This balanced idiom pairs a large gallbladder (胆大, representing courage) with a fine/careful heart (心细), originating from Ming Dynasty military manuals. Traditional Chinese medicine associated the gallbladder with courage and decision-making, while the heart governed careful thinking. The combination described the ideal military commander who could make bold decisions while attending to crucial details. During the Qing Dynasty, it expanded beyond military contexts to describe the optimal approach to any challenging enterprise. Modern usage describes the powerful combination of courage with caution, particularly in high-stakes situations where both boldness and precision prove necessary for success, suggesting that true effectiveness often requires seemingly contradictory qualities in perfect balance.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The firefighter showed both courage and meticulous attention to safety protocols
