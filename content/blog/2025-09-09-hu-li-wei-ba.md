**Pronunciation:** *hú li wěi ba*  
**Literal meaning:** Fox's tail

## Origin & Usage

This revealing idiom references a fox's (狐狸) tail (尾巴) as something hidden that eventually shows itself, originating from Tang Dynasty folklore where foxes could transform into humans but struggled to conceal their tails completely. These stories reflected the belief that true nature inevitably reveals itself despite disguise. During the Song Dynasty, it became shorthand in political discourse for hidden motives eventually exposed. The fox metaphor was particularly powerful as foxes represented cunning deception in Chinese culture. Modern usage describes how underlying intentions or true character eventually become visible despite careful concealment, particularly when someone attempting to hide their real nature inadvertently reveals it through unguarded words or actions.

## Examples

**English:** "His careful public image slipped, revealing his true selfish intentions"

**Chinese:** 他精心设计的公众形象滑落，暴露了他真正的自私意图
