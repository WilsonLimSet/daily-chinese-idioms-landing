**Pronunciation:** *wén bù jiā diǎn*  
**Literal meaning:** Writing needing no corrections

## Origin & Usage

This flawless idiom describes writing (文) that needs no (不) added (加) corrections (点), referencing Three Kingdoms period literary genius Lu Ji. Historical accounts claim Lu's compositions emerged so perfect that no markings or corrections were needed—extraordinary in an era when editing involved adding dots to indicate changes. During the Tang Dynasty, as literary composition became central to advancement, the phrase represented the ultimate in literary accomplishment. The specific reference to 'dots' connected to actual editing practices where correction marks resembled dots. Modern usage describes work of such high initial quality that it requires no revision, particularly creative or intellectual output that emerges in its final form through exceptional skill rather than iterative improvement.

## Examples

**English:** "The novelist's manuscript was so perfect it required no editorial changes"

**Chinese:** 这位小说家的手稿如此完美，不需要任何编辑修改
