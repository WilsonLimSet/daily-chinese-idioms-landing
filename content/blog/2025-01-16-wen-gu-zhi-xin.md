**Pronunciation:** *wēn gù zhī xīn*  
**Literal meaning:** Review old know new

## Origin & Usage

This idiom comes directly from Confucius's teaching that by reviewing (温) the old (故), one can understand (知) the new (新). The metaphor originally referred to warming up old food to make it fresh again, suggesting that knowledge requires regular review to remain vital. During the Tang Dynasty, it became a fundamental principle of classical education, emphasizing that true learning combines respect for tradition with openness to new insights. The concept gained particular significance during the Song Dynasty renaissance, when scholars reinterpreted classical texts for contemporary challenges. Modern usage emphasizes the value of using historical knowledge to understand present situations, particularly relevant in fields like policy-making, business strategy, and cultural studies.
