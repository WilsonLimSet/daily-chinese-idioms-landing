**Pronunciation:** *bì yuè xiū huā*  
**Literal meaning:** Moon hides flowers shy

## Origin & Usage

Originating from descriptions of the legendary beauty Yang Guifei, one of China's Four Great Beauties, this idiom suggests a beauty so radiant it could cause the moon (月) to hide (闭) and flowers (花) to feel shame (羞). The phrase first appeared in Tang Dynasty poetry, reflecting the period's aesthetic ideals where natural phenomena served as measures of human beauty. Court historians noted how Yang's presence would dim the brilliance of celestial bodies and outshine the garden's finest blooms. While historically used exclusively for physical beauty, modern usage has evolved to celebrate any form of excellence that outshines its surroundings, though it retains strong associations with feminine grace and beauty.
