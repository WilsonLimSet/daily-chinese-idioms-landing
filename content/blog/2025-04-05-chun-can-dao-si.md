**Pronunciation:** *chūn cán dào sǐ*  
**Literal meaning:** Spring silkworm until death

## Origin & Usage

The poignant image of the spring (春) silkworm (蚕) spinning until death (死) emerged from ancient observations of sericulture, where silkworms produce silk continuously until their final moments. This idiom gained particular resonance during the Tang Dynasty, appearing prominently in love poetry and literature to represent the ultimate expression of devotion and sacrifice. The silkworm's intensive labor of producing silk, literally transforming its life essence into something beautiful and valuable, became a powerful metaphor for selfless dedication. Appearing in numerous classical poems, including works by Li Shangyin, it drew parallels between the silkworm's natural devotion and human commitment. In contemporary use, it often describes professionals like teachers, artists, researchers, or caregivers who continue their work with unwavering dedication despite personal costs.
