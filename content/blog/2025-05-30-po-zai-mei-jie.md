**Pronunciation:** *pò zài méi jié*  
**Literal meaning:** Urgent as brow and lash

## Origin & Usage

This visceral idiom describes urgency so pressing (迫) it's between (在) the eyebrows (眉) and eyelashes (睫). Its earliest recorded use comes from Tang Dynasty military dispatches, where commanders needed to convey the immediate nature of threats. The anatomical metaphor was chosen deliberately - the space between brow and lash is minimal, suggesting no room for delay. The phrase gained wider use during the Song Dynasty as commerce accelerated and time-sensitive decisions became more common. Modern usage spans from business deadlines to environmental crises, capturing situations where the pressure of time is almost physically felt.

## Examples

**English:** "The deadline was so close that immediate action was necessary"

**Chinese:** 截止日期迫在眉睫，需要立即采取行动
