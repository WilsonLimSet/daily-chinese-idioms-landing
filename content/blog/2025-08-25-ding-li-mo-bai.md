**Pronunciation:** *dǐng lǐ mó bài*  
**Literal meaning:** Highest reverence and worship

## Origin & Usage

This reverential idiom combines the highest form of respect (顶礼) with devout worship (膜拜), originating from Buddhist ritual practices during the Eastern Han Dynasty. It described the complete prostration where devotees touched their foreheads to the ground before Buddha statues or revered monks. The specific posture represented the ultimate physical expression of reverence in Chinese culture. During the Tang Dynasty, as Buddhism flourished, the phrase entered secular contexts to describe exceptional admiration. Unlike terms for simple respect, it specifically describes adoration approaching religious devotion. Modern usage describes extreme admiration or hero-worship, particularly toward cultural icons, intellectual figures, or industry pioneers whose achievements inspire profound reverence.

## Examples

**English:** "Fans treated the famous musician with almost religious adoration"

**Chinese:** 粉丝们对这位著名音乐家几乎是宗教般的崇拜
