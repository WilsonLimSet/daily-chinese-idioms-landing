**Pronunciation:** *zhòng kǒu shuò jīn*  
**Literal meaning:** Many mouths melt gold

## Origin & Usage

This powerful metaphor suggests that numerous (众) mouths (口) speaking together can melt (铄) even gold (金). Originating in the Han Dynasty, it reflects the ancient Chinese understanding of public opinion's force. The image of collective voices generating enough heat to melt precious metal dramatically illustrates how widespread discussion can reshape even seemingly unalterable truths. Historical texts show its use in political discourse, warning rulers about the power of public sentiment. Modern applications emphasize how persistent public opinion can transform established reputations or challenge seemingly immutable facts.

## Examples

**English:** "The social media campaign succeeded in changing the company's policy"

**Chinese:** 社交媒体运动成功改变了公司的政策
