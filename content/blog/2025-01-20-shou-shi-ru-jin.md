**Pronunciation:** *shǒu shí rú jīn*  
**Literal meaning:** Value time like gold

## Origin & Usage

This idiom, emerging during the Song Dynasty's growing commercial culture, equates valuing (如) time (时) with gold (金). It gained prominence as mechanical water clocks improved timekeeping precision, making punctuality increasingly important in civil service and commerce. The comparison was particularly meaningful as gold was not just precious but also finite and irreplaceable, like time itself. During the Ming Dynasty, the concept became central to merchant ethics and official conduct. Modern usage emphasizes professional reliability and time management, particularly in business contexts where punctuality indicates respect and professionalism. It reflects a universal truth that time, unlike most resources, can never be recovered once lost.

## Examples

**English:** "She always arrived early for meetings, respecting everyone's time"
