**Pronunciation:** *rù xiāng suí sú*  
**Literal meaning:** Enter village follow customs

## Origin & Usage

Dating back to the Warring States period, this idiom advises those who enter (入) a village (乡) to follow (随) local customs (俗). Historical accounts tell of diplomatic missions that succeeded or failed based on their adherence to this principle. The concept gained particular significance during the Tang Dynasty's cosmopolitan period, when merchants and diplomats traversed the Silk Road. Beyond simple advice for travelers, it reflects deeper philosophical insights about cultural respect and adaptability. Modern applications range from international business etiquette to immigrant experiences, advocating for cultural intelligence without losing one's identity. The idiom captures the delicate balance between respecting local norms and maintaining authentic self-expression.

## Examples

**English:** "She adapted to local customs when working abroad"

**Chinese:** 她在国外工作时入乡随俗
