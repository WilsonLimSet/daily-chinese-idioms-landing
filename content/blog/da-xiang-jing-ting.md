**Pronunciation:** *dà xiāng jìng tíng*  
**Literal meaning:** Greatly different like paths and courtyards

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes things as different as paths (径) and courtyards (庭) - completely (大相) dissimilar. The phrase comes from 'Zhuangzi,' where it described the vast difference between the Dao and ordinary understanding. Paths lead away while courtyards are enclosed spaces - fundamentally different in nature and direction. Modern usage describes opinions, approaches, or outcomes that differ substantially, emphasizing significant rather than minor differences.

## Examples

**English:** "Their views on the matter are completely different."

**Chinese:** 他们对这件事的看法大相径庭。
