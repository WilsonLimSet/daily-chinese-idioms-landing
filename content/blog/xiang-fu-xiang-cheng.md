**Pronunciation:** *xiāng fǔ xiāng chéng*  
**Literal meaning:** Mutually assist mutually complete

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes things that mutually (相) support (辅) and mutually (相) complete (成) each other. The phrase reflects the Chinese philosophical understanding of complementary opposites and dynamic balance. It emerged from discussions of governance in classical texts, describing how different elements work together for optimal results. Unlike Western notions of independence, this concept emphasizes productive interdependence. Modern usage describes synergistic relationships where elements strengthen each other through interaction.
