**Pronunciation:** *xué hǎi wú yá*  
**Literal meaning:** Ocean of learning has no shores

## Origin & Usage

This idiom comes from a longer phrase '学海无涯，苦作舟渡' - the sea (海) of learning (学) has no shores (无涯), but hard work is the boat that crosses it. First appearing in Song Dynasty scholarly texts, it gained prominence during the Ming period when private academies flourished. The ocean metaphor was especially meaningful as classical education required navigating vast bodies of literature. Modern usage emphasizes both the endless nature of learning in our information age and the humility required for true scholarship. Particularly popular in academic settings, it reminds us that knowledge is boundless, and even experts must maintain a learner's mindset throughout their lives.

## Examples

**English:** "Even at 80, she continues to learn new things every day"
