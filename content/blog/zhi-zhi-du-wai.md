**Pronunciation:** *zhì zhī dù wài*  
**Literal meaning:** Place it beyond consideration

## Origin & Usage

This idiom means to place (置) something (之) outside (外) the bounds of consideration (度). It originates from historical texts describing generals and heroes who disregarded personal safety for greater causes. The phrase emphasizes deliberate exclusion of certain factors - often personal risk, comfort, or gain - from one's decision-making. While sometimes used critically for recklessness, it more often praises courage and commitment that transcends self-interest. Modern usage describes ignoring obstacles or dangers in pursuit of important goals.

## Examples

**English:** "He ignored the risks and pursued his dream regardless."

**Chinese:** 他将风险置之度外，执着追求自己的梦想。
