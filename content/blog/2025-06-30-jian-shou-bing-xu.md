**Pronunciation:** *jiān shōu bìng xù*  
**Literal meaning:** Gather all store together

## Origin & Usage

This inclusive approach advocates gathering (收) comprehensively (兼) while storing (蓄) everything together (并), originating from Tang Dynasty intellectual movements. It gained prominence through scholar-officials like Liu Zongyuan who advocated synthesizing Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist wisdom rather than rigid adherence to a single tradition. The phrase reflected a cosmopolitan philosophy emerging during Tang China's international golden age. During the Song renaissance, it became a methodological principle for encyclopedic scholarship that sought to preserve diverse knowledge systems. Modern usage celebrates intellectual openness and cross-disciplinary integration, particularly in research contexts where innovative solutions emerge from combining seemingly unrelated approaches.

## Examples

**English:** "Her research methodology incorporated diverse approaches from multiple disciplines"

**Chinese:** 她的研究方法融合了多个学科的各种方法
