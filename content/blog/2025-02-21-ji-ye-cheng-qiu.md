**Pronunciation:** *jí yè chéng qiú*  
**Literal meaning:** Gather fur make coat

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from ancient Chinese furriers who gathered (集) small pieces of fur from animal armpits (腋) to make (成) a luxurious coat (裘). First recorded in Warring States period texts, it illustrated how seemingly insignificant items could, through accumulation and patience, create something valuable. The detailed craft metaphor resonated with Chinese philosophical emphasis on gradual progress and careful accumulation. Modern applications range from financial advice about saving to project management principles about breaking large goals into smaller tasks. It teaches that no contribution is too small when part of a larger vision.

## Examples

**English:** "The charity reached its goal through thousands of small donations"

**Chinese:** 慈善机构通过成千上万的小额捐款达到了目标
