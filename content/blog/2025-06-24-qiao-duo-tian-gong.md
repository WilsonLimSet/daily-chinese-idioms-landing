**Pronunciation:** *qiǎo duó tiān gōng*  
**Literal meaning:** Skill surpasses nature's work

## Origin & Usage

This expression praises human craftsmanship so skillful (巧) it seems to surpass (夺) heaven's/nature's (天) work (工), first appearing in Han Dynasty art criticism. It originated from evaluations of exceptional jade carvings and bronze vessels that achieved seemingly impossible refinement. The concept was revolutionary in Chinese aesthetics, suggesting human creativity could potentially exceed natural beauty. During the Song Dynasty renaissance, it became associated with unprecedented technical innovations. The tension between respecting nature and transcending its limitations reflected Chinese philosophical debates about human potential. Modern usage celebrates exceptional craftsmanship or technical achievement that pushes boundaries of what seems possible, from traditional arts to cutting-edge technology.

## Examples

**English:** "The intricate jade carving exceeded what seemed humanly possible"

**Chinese:** 这件精细的玉雕超越了人力所能及的极限
