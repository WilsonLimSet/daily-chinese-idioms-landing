**Pronunciation:** *ān rán wú yàng*
**Literal meaning:** Peaceful without illness

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from the 'Records of the Three Kingdoms' describing survivors of catastrophe. The term '恙' originally referred specifically to plague or epidemic disease before broadening to general harm. During the Jin Dynasty, it became shorthand in military reporting for troops surviving dangerous missions. Being peacefully (安然) without illness or harm (无恙) was a particularly potent medical metaphor in pre-modern China where disease represented one of life's most common and unpredictable threats. Unlike terms simply meaning 'safe,' it specifically emphasizes emerging completely unharmed from dangerous circumstances. Modern usage spans disaster response to personal crises, describing complete preservation through perilous circumstances, particularly when expressing the emotional relief following confirmation that loved ones have survived unchanged through genuine danger.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Despite the severe typhoon, all villagers were safely evacuated and accounted for
