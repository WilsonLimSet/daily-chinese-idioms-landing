**Pronunciation:** *xīn gān qíng yuàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Heart sweet feeling willing

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes a state where the heart (心) finds sweetness (甘) and feelings (情) are willing (愿). It emphasizes genuine, voluntary acceptance without resentment or coercion. The phrase appeared in Tang Dynasty poetry describing devotion freely given. The combination of emotional satisfaction with willingness suggests actions taken not from duty but from genuine desire. Modern usage describes wholehearted willingness, often in contexts of sacrifice or service where the person finds genuine fulfillment.
