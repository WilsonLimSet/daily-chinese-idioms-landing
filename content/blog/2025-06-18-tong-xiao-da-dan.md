**Pronunciation:** *tōng xiāo dá dàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Through night reach dawn

## Origin & Usage

This temporal idiom describes working throughout (通) the night (宵) until reaching (达) dawn (旦), dating to Han Dynasty accounts of diligent officials. It gained prominence through stories of the Northern Song scholar-official Sima Guang, who reportedly studied through countless nights while compiling his monumental historical work. The specific character 旦 (dawn) depicts the sun rising above the horizon, creating a vivid image of persistence until natural conclusion. Unlike terms for simple overnight work, it carries connotations of necessary dedication to complete important tasks. Modern usage spans emergency response situations to academic and professional crunch periods, describing effort that continues uninterrupted until natural completion.

## Examples

**English:** "The medical team worked continuously until they stabilized all emergency patients"

**Chinese:** 医疗团队连续工作，直到所有急诊患者病情稳定
