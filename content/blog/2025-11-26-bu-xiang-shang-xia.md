**Pronunciation:** *bù xiāng shàng xià*
**Literal meaning:** Not mutually up down

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty military strategists developed this elegant phrase to describe forces without (不) mutual (相) superiority or inferiority (上下). Initially used for armies whose different strengths created overall parity, Tang Dynasty writers expanded it to compare everything from scholarly works to artistic performances. The spatial metaphor proves particularly effective in Chinese culture, where vertical positioning traditionally represents hierarchy.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The two championship finalists were so evenly matched that predicting a winner was impossible
