**Pronunciation:** *zǒu mǎ kàn huā*
**Literal meaning:** Galloping horse views flowers

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes viewing flowers (看花) while galloping past on horseback (走马), originating from Tang Dynasty poet Li Shangyin's verses lamenting hasty appreciation of beauty. The image perfectly captures the blur of motion - a rider glimpsing floral colors without perceiving individual petals or fragrances. During the Song Dynasty, scholars adopted it to criticize superficial engagement with art and literature. The contrast between rapid movement and delicate beauty creates a perfect metaphor for modern life's rushed experiences. Today it describes everything from whirlwind tourism to speed-reading, warning against prioritizing breadth over depth.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The whirlwind tour gave tourists only a superficial impression of the country's culture
