**Pronunciation:** *fù zhòng qián xíng*  
**Literal meaning:** Carry weight march forward

## Origin & Usage

Emerging from Tang Dynasty (618-907) Buddhist texts, this idiom depicts the image of carrying (负) weight (重) while marching (行) forward (前). It originally described the bodhisattva's dedication to helping others while pursuing enlightenment. The metaphor resonated with Confucian scholars who saw public service as a similar burden of responsibility. In contemporary usage, it captures the essence of persevering through difficulties while bearing responsibilities - from entrepreneurs maintaining businesses through crises to individuals supporting families through hardship. The imagery emphasizes dignified endurance rather than mere survival.

## Examples

**English:** "Despite family obligations, she continued pursuing her education"

**Chinese:** 尽管有家庭责任，她仍然继续追求教育
