**Pronunciation:** *diū sān là sì*
**Literal meaning:** Lose three drop four

## Origin & Usage

Ming Dynasty vernacular speech captured this pattern of losing three things (丢三) and dropping four (落四). The non-sequential numbers created a perfect image of random, unpredictable losses rather than systematic problems. Qing Dynasty officials adopted it to evaluate servant reliability. Today it describes that particular type of disorganization where items constantly go missing, revealing an underlying attention deficit rather than mere carelessness.

## When to Use

**Situation:** She frequently misplaced her keys, phone, and important documents
