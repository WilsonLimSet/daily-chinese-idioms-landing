**Pronunciation:** *ěr rú mù rǎn*  
**Literal meaning:** Ears soaked, eyes dyed

## Origin & Usage

This idiom emerged from Han Dynasty educational philosophy, describing how the ears (耳) are soaked (濡) and the eyes (目) are dyed (染) by constant exposure. It gained particular relevance in families of traditional craftsmen, where children learned complex skills through constant exposure rather than formal instruction. The Tang Dynasty saw it adopted into Buddhist teachings about the importance of surrounding oneself with positive influences. Modern usage spans from cultural immersion to professional development, acknowledging how prolonged exposure shapes us more profoundly than explicit teaching.

## When to Use
