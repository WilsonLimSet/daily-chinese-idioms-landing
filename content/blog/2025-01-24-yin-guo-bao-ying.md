**Pronunciation:** *yīn guǒ bào yìng*  
**Literal meaning:** Cause and effect return

## Origin & Usage

This idiom encapsulates the Buddhist concept that causes (因) and effects (果) inevitably return (报应) as consequences. Introduced with Buddhism during the Han Dynasty, it gained widespread acceptance during the Tang period, offering a sophisticated framework for understanding moral causation. The concept differs from simple fate by emphasizing personal responsibility and the complex interconnection of actions and consequences. During the Song Dynasty, it influenced Neo-Confucian thought, combining with traditional Chinese ethics. Modern usage extends beyond religious contexts to describe how actions inevitably have consequences, particularly in discussions of ethics, environmental responsibility, and long-term planning.

## Examples

**English:** "His kindness to others eventually came back to benefit him"

**Chinese:** 他对他人的善意最终回报到了他身上
