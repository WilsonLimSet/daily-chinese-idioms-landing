## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes unreasonably (妄) self (自) belittling (菲薄). It originated from Zhuge Liang's famous memorial to the Emperor of Shu, advising against excessive self-deprecation that could harm the state. The phrase warns that false modesty can be as damaging as arrogance. Modern usage encourages healthy self-esteem and warns against self-undermining behavior that limits potential.
