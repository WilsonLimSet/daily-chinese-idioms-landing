## Origin & Usage

This dramatic idiom captures the sudden (突) change (变) in wind (风) and clouds (云), drawing from ancient Chinese meteorological observations. Originated during the Tang Dynasty in military texts describing battlefield conditions, it reflects the Chinese understanding of natural forces as omens. The swift transformation of weather became a metaphor for rapid shifts in circumstances beyond human control. Contemporary usage extends to any abrupt change in situation, from political upheavals to market fluctuations, emphasizing both the unpredictability and interconnectedness of events.
