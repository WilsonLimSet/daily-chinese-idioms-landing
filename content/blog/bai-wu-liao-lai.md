## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes having a hundred (百) times nothing (无) to depend on or occupy (聊赖). It captures extreme boredom and listlessness when one has nothing meaningful to engage with. The phrase appeared in texts describing idle officials or those in forced retirement. It represents not just boredom but a deeper sense of purposelessness. Modern usage describes profound boredom, aimlessness, or the melancholy of having nothing to occupy one's time meaningfully.
