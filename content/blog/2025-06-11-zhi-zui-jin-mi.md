**Pronunciation:** *zhǐ zuì jīn mí*  
**Literal meaning:** Paper drunk gold confused

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes a decadent lifestyle where one becomes intoxicated (醉) with wealth symbolized by gold (金) and surrounded by deeds/contracts on paper (纸) to the point of confusion (迷). First appearing in Tang Dynasty poetry criticizing wealthy merchant households, it gained prominence during the Song Dynasty's commercial boom. The phrase captured the moral concerns about newly wealthy classes who lacked traditional scholarly values. The pairing of paper (representing contracts and promissory notes) with gold reflected the emerging money economy. Modern usage describes lavish, hedonistic environments from exclusive nightclubs to luxury developments, carrying subtle criticism of empty materialism that intoxicates while offering no genuine fulfillment.

## Examples

**English:** "The young heirs lived in luxury, oblivious to the real world's hardships"
