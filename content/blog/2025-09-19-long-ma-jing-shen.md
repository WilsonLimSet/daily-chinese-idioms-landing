**Pronunciation:** *lóng mǎ jīng shén*  
**Literal meaning:** Dragon-horse spirit

## Origin & Usage

This vigorous idiom combines dragon (龙) and horse (马) energy (精神), originating from Tang Dynasty descriptions of elderly but energetic officials. Both animals symbolized tremendous vitality in Chinese culture—dragons representing imperial power and horses signifying tireless strength. The phrase gained prominence during the Song Dynasty, when Confucian values emphasized continued contribution regardless of age. Unlike terms for simple endurance, it specifically celebrates dynamic energy and enthusiasm persisting into advanced years. Modern usage honors elderly individuals who maintain youthful vigor and productivity well beyond expected age-related decline, particularly those who continue meaningful contributions to society, embodying the traditional Chinese value that wisdom and vitality can complement rather than diminish each other.
