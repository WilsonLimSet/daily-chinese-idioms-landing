**Pronunciation:** *tuō yǐng ér chū*  
**Literal meaning:** Tip of awl emerges from bag

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from a story where the advisor Mao Sui described talent like an awl in a bag - if truly sharp, its tip (颖) will emerge (脱而出). The phrase describes exceptional ability that becomes visible despite obscurity. It appeared in 'Records of the Grand Historian' praising those whose merit cannot be hidden. Modern usage describes standing out from a group, particularly through demonstrated excellence that distinguishes one from competitors.
