**Pronunciation:** *rù mù sān fēn*  
**Literal meaning:** Enter wood three tenths

## Origin & Usage

This penetrating idiom describes writing that enters (入) wood (木) to a depth of three-tenths (三分) of an inch, originating from praise for Jin Dynasty calligrapher Wang Xizhi. Historical accounts claim his brush strokes were so powerful they penetrated wooden writing tablets to remarkable depth. During the Tang Dynasty, the phrase expanded beyond calligraphy to describe any profound impact or penetrating insight. The specific measurement 'three-tenths' was significant in traditional Chinese units, representing substantial but not excessive penetration. Modern usage describes incisive analysis or powerful expression that penetrates beyond surfaces to reach deeper significance, particularly in intellectual contexts where depth of understanding is valued over superficial observations.

## Examples

**English:** "Her critique penetrated to the core issues of the flawed proposal"
