**Pronunciation:** *tiě chǔ chéng zhēn*  
**Literal meaning:** Iron rod becomes needle

## Origin & Usage

The tale of an elderly woman grinding an iron (铁) pestle (杵) into a needle (针) dates to the Northern Song Dynasty. When Li Bai saw her task, she explained that with enough persistence, even the impossible becomes possible. Her story became so influential that the actual grinding stone was preserved in Chengdu until the late Qing Dynasty. The story spread through educational texts, emphasizing how seemingly insurmountable tasks yield to unwavering determination. The physical impossibility of the task makes the metaphor particularly powerful – the focus isn't on the literal transformation but the spirit of perseverance. During the Ming Dynasty, it became a standard teaching tool in private academies. In contemporary usage, it inspires those facing daunting challenges, from medical students preparing for licensing exams to entrepreneurs building startups from scratch.
