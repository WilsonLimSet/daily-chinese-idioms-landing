**Pronunciation:** *mén tíng ruò shì*  
**Literal meaning:** Doorway busy as market

## Origin & Usage

This vivid idiom describes a household's entrance (门庭) being as busy as a marketplace (若市). It originated during the Han Dynasty, initially describing the homes of influential officials where countless visitors sought audience. The metaphor gained particular significance during the Tang Dynasty, when it came to represent both social success and intellectual influence. Notable examples include the residence of poet Bai Juyi, where fellow scholars gathered in such numbers that his gateway resembled a bustling market. Modern usage extends beyond literal crowds to indicate popularity, influence, or high demand - whether describing a successful business, a popular professor's office hours, or a sought-after professional's schedule.

**English:** "The new restaurant was so popular that it was always packed with customers"
