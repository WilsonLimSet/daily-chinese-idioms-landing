**Pronunciation:** *tóng zhōu gòng jì*  
**Literal meaning:** Cross river in same boat

## Origin & Usage

This idiom shares deep connections with China's river-centric civilization, where crossing (济) together (共) in the same boat (同舟) was often a matter of life and death. Ancient texts tell of strangers becoming allies when facing treacherous waters, especially along the mighty Yangtze. During the Three Kingdoms period, multiple accounts describe opposing armies cooperating to navigate dangerous rapids. The imagery powerfully conveys mutual dependence and collective survival. Modern applications extend to corporate partnerships, international cooperation on global challenges, and community resilience during crises. The idiom emphasizes that differences become secondary when facing shared challenges – whether environmental disasters, economic hardships, or social upheavals.

## Examples

**English:** "The community united to help those affected by the disaster"

**Chinese:** 社区团结起来帮助受灾群众
