**Pronunciation:** *fēng shēng hè lì*  
**Literal meaning:** Wind sound crane call

## Origin & Usage

Dating back to the Jin Dynasty (265-420 CE), this idiom emerged from the aftermath of the Battle of Fei River. The defeated army became so paranoid that they mistook every wind (风) sound (声) and crane's (鹤) cry (唳) for enemy movements. The image draws from the watchful nature of cranes, known in Chinese culture as vigilant birds that react to the slightest disturbance. Originally describing excessive paranoia born from genuine threats, it evolved in classical literature to represent heightened anxiety and overcautiousness. In modern usage, it often describes situations where past trauma or intense pressure leads to oversensitivity - from market traders seeing crashes in every fluctuation to organizations becoming overly risk-averse after setbacks.
