**Pronunciation:** *bù kě jiù yào*
**Literal meaning:** Cannot be saved by medicine

## Origin & Usage

The great physician Zhang Zhongjing's 'Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders' introduced this concept of conditions that cannot (不可) be cured by medicine (救药). Tang Dynasty Buddhist writers expanded its meaning beyond physical ailments to describe moral corruption beyond redemption. When even the most skilled physician acknowledges the limits of their art, it suggests a truly hopeless situation. Modern usage spans from addiction to systemic problems where even expert intervention proves futile.

## When to Use

**Situation:** His gambling addiction had reached a point where intervention seemed futile
