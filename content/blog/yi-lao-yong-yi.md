**Pronunciation:** *yī láo yǒng yì*  
**Literal meaning:** One labor forever ease

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes one (一) effort (劳) that brings forever (永) ease (逸). It originated in Han Dynasty texts discussing efficient governance - solving problems thoroughly so they don't recur. The phrase values definitive solutions over temporary fixes. It reflects the practical wisdom of investing effort upfront to avoid perpetual maintenance. Modern usage describes permanent solutions that eliminate recurring problems, though it can also be used critically when such solutions prove illusory.
