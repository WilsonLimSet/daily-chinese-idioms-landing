**Pronunciation:** *lái lóng qù mài*  
**Literal meaning:** Coming dragon and going veins

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from Chinese geomancy (feng shui), where 'dragon' (龙) refers to mountain ranges and 'veins' (脉) to their extensions. Geomancers traced the 'coming dragon' and 'going veins' to understand the landscape's energy flow. The phrase evolved to mean tracing the origins and developments of any matter - its causes, progression, and connections. It emphasizes the importance of understanding context and history. Modern usage describes investigating or explaining the full background and development of a situation or event.

## Examples

**English:** "Before making a decision, we need to understand the full context."

**Chinese:** 做决定之前，我们需要了解事情的来龙去脉。
