**Pronunciation:** *rěn jùn bù jīn*  
**Literal meaning:** Cannot suppress a smile

## Origin & Usage

This amused idiom describes being unable (不禁) to suppress (忍) a smile or laughter (俊), originating from Six Dynasties period literary descriptions. It first appeared in court chronicles describing officials maintaining composure despite amusing situations. The specific character '俊' originally referred to the slight facial movements preceding laughter. During the Tang Dynasty, it gained prominence in poetry describing elegantly restrained emotional responses. Unlike terms for uncontrolled laughter, it specifically describes the moment when attempted composure breaks despite social constraints. Modern usage captures situations where humor overcomes formal restraint, particularly in contexts where decorum would normally prevent visible amusement, suggesting genuine humor often proves irrepressible despite social conventions.

## Examples

**English:** "Even the stern professor couldn't help smiling at the clever comment"

**Chinese:** 即使是严厉的教授也忍不住对这个机智的评论微笑
