**Pronunciation:** *jīng yì qiú jīng*  
**Literal meaning:** Perfect seek more perfect

## Origin & Usage

This philosophy traces back to the Spring and Autumn period's craftsman traditions, where artisans (精) would continuously refine (益) their work while seeking (求) even greater refinement. The concept gained prominence during the Song Dynasty when unprecedented technological advances drove craftsmen to pursue ever-higher standards. A famous example comes from Lu Ban's treatise on carpentry, describing how master woodworkers would spend years perfecting a single joint technique. Today, this mindset drives innovation in fields from software development to culinary arts, embodying the idea that even excellence can be improved upon. Japanese manufacturers adopted this principle as 'kaizen,' though the Chinese origin emphasizes the relentless pursuit of perfection rather than gradual improvement.

## Examples

**English:** "The software team continued refining their already excellent product"

**Chinese:** 软件团队不断完善他们已经很优秀的产品
