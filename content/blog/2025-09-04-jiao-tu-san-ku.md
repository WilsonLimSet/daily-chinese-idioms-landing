**Pronunciation:** *jiǎo tù sān kū*  
**Literal meaning:** Clever rabbit has three burrows

## Origin & Usage

This strategic idiom describes how a clever (狡) rabbit (兔) maintains three (三) burrows (窟), originating from the Warring States period text 'Strategies of the Warring States.' It recounts advice from statesman Fan Li that one should never rely on a single refuge or strategy. The specific number three represented 'multiple' in classical Chinese numerology rather than a literal count. During the Han Dynasty, military strategists adopted this as a core principle of contingency planning. Unlike terms for simple cleverness, it specifically addresses preparedness through strategic redundancy. Modern usage emphasizes maintaining multiple options or fallback positions, particularly in competitive environments where adaptability and alternative approaches often prove crucial for survival and success.

## Examples

**English:** "The experienced businessman maintained multiple backup plans for every venture"

**Chinese:** 这位经验丰富的商人为每个投资项目都准备了多个备用方案
