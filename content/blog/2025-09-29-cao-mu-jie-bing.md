**Pronunciation:** *cǎo mù jiē bīng*  
**Literal meaning:** Grass trees all soldiers

## Origin & Usage

This psychological idiom describes seeing grass (草) and trees (木) all (皆) as soldiers (兵), originating from the Three Kingdoms period where a defeated general became so fearful during retreat that rustling vegetation appeared as enemy troops. The phrase gained broader usage during the Tang Dynasty, describing siege mentality among threatened officials. The natural imagery vividly captured how fear transforms ordinary surroundings into perceived threats. Modern usage describes how anxiety can distort perception, particularly relevant in high-stress situations where past trauma influences current judgment.

## When to Use

**Situation:** After the security breach, the paranoid CEO suspected every employee of potential espionage
