**Pronunciation:** *shùn qí zì rán*  
**Literal meaning:** Follow its natural course

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes following (顺) the natural (自然) course of things (其). It embodies Daoist philosophy of wu wei (non-action) - working with natural forces rather than against them. The phrase advises acceptance of circumstances and allowing events to unfold without forced intervention. It represents wisdom in knowing when to act and when to allow natural processes to proceed. Modern usage counsels patience and acceptance in situations beyond one's control.

## Examples

**English:** "Instead of forcing things, she decided to let events unfold naturally."

**Chinese:** 她决定顺其自然，不再强求。
