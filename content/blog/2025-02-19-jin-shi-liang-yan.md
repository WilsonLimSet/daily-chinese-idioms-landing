**Pronunciation:** *jīn shí liáng yán*  
**Literal meaning:** Gold and stone good words

## Origin & Usage

Originating in early Chinese metallurgy, this idiom equates valuable advice to gold (金) and stone (石) - materials known for their durability and value. The term good words (良言) gained special significance during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE) when adviser roles became crucial in statecraft. The metaphor suggests that truly valuable advice, like precious metals and stones, maintains its worth across time. Modern usage describes advice or wisdom that proves particularly enduring and valuable, often emphasizing the rare combination of practicality and moral insight. It frequently appears in contexts of mentorship and professional guidance.

## Examples

**English:** "Her mentor's guidance proved invaluable throughout her career"
