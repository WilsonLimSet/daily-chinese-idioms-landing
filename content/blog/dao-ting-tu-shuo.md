**Pronunciation:** *dào tīng tú shuō*
**Literal meaning:** Road hear path say

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty scholars coined this phrase about information heard (听) on roads (道) and spoken (说) on paths (途) to distinguish between verified knowledge and casual transmission. Tang Dynasty historians used it to flag dubious sources. The spatial metaphor of public thoroughfares perfectly captured information spreading without institutional verification. Modern media critics still wage war against such unverified transmission.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The report was based on unverified rumors rather than documented evidence
