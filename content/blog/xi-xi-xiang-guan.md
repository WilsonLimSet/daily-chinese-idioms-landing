**Pronunciation:** *xī xī xiāng guān*  
**Literal meaning:** Breath to breath mutually connected

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes being connected breath (息) to breath (息), mutually (相) related (关). The breathing metaphor suggests connection as intimate as shared respiration, where one cannot survive without the other. The phrase emphasizes interdependence so close that changes in one immediately affect the other. It reflects the Chinese philosophical view of universal interconnection. Modern usage commonly describes tightly linked phenomena, policies, or outcomes where impact flows bidirectionally.

## Examples

**English:** "Environmental protection is closely linked to public health."

**Chinese:** 环境保护与公众健康息息相关。
