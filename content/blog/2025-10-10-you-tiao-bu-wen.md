**Pronunciation:** *yǒu tiáo bù wěn*
**Literal meaning:** Have order not chaotic

## Origin & Usage

This orderliness idiom describes having clear threads (有条) without tangling (不紊), originating from Han Dynasty textile terminology. It first described proper silk thread management during weaving, where preventing tangling determined product quality. The metaphor was particularly apt in Chinese culture where silk production represented sophisticated civilization. During the Tang Dynasty, it transcended craft contexts to describe administrative organization. Modern usage spans emergency management to project coordination, describing processes that maintain logical sequence and clear relationships between components, particularly under pressure when disorganization threatens.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Despite the emergency, the hospital staff handled the situation with methodical precision
