**Pronunciation:** *zhòng zhì chéng chéng*  
**Literal meaning:** Many wills make wall

## Origin & Usage

This architectural metaphor shows how many wills (众志) can form an impenetrable wall (城), drawing from ancient Chinese defensive architecture. It gained significance during the Warring States period when city walls required massive coordinated effort to construct and defend. Historical records detail how communities united to build city walls in record time when facing invasion. The idiom emphasizes how collective determination creates strong defenses. Modern usage extends to team efforts and community initiatives, highlighting how unity and shared purpose can overcome seemingly impossible challenges.
