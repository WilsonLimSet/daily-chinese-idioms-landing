**Pronunciation:** *dé tiān dú hòu*
**Literal meaning:** Receive heaven unique favor

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from Tang Dynasty geographical descriptions of particularly fortunate territories, first documenting regions with exceptional natural endowments like fertile soil, favorable climate, and strategic positioning. During the Song Dynasty, it expanded beyond geography to innate human talents. The concept of receiving (得) heaven's (天) unique (独) abundance/favor (厚) had a particularly significant cosmological attribution—'heaven' established these advantages as objective, inherent qualities rather than subjective assessment. Unlike terms simply meaning 'fortunate,' it specifically addresses structural, intrinsic advantages rather than temporary good luck. Modern usage spans geographic resources to innate talent, describing fundamentally advantageous conditions that exist prior to any human effort, particularly when these foundations create inherent competitive advantages regardless of subsequent development choices.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The coastal region's ideal climate and natural harbor created exceptional development advantages
