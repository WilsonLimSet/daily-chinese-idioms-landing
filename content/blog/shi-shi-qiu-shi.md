**Pronunciation:** *shí shì qiú shì*  
**Literal meaning:** Seek truth from facts

## Origin & Usage

This idiom means seeking (求) truth (是) from actual facts (实事). It originated from the Han Dynasty 'Book of Han' describing the scholarly approach of Emperor Xian of Han. The phrase emphasizes basing conclusions on evidence rather than theory or wishful thinking. It became a guiding principle in modern Chinese political philosophy, particularly promoted by Deng Xiaoping. Modern usage advocates for pragmatic, evidence-based approaches in research, policy, and decision-making.

## Examples

**English:** "Scientific research must be based on evidence rather than assumptions."

**Chinese:** 科学研究必须实事求是，以证据为基础。
