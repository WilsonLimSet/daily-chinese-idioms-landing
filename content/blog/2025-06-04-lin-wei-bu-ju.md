**Pronunciation:** *lín wēi bù jù*  
**Literal meaning:** Face danger without fear

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes facing (临) danger (危) without (不) fear (惧), originating from accounts of general Yue Fei's courage during the Southern Song Dynasty. Historical chronicles record how Yue maintained composure under extreme battlefield conditions, inspiring his troops to victory against superior forces. The phrase gained wider circulation through Ming Dynasty military texts that analyzed psychological factors in warfare. Unlike reckless bravery, it describes clear-headed courage that assesses risks while remaining steadfast. Modern usage honors professionals who perform under pressure - from emergency responders to crisis managers - emphasizing that true courage acknowledges fear but isn't paralyzed by it.

## Examples

**English:** "The firefighter rushed into the burning building without hesitation"
