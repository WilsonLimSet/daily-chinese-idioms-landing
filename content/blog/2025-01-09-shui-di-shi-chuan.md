**Pronunciation:** *shuǐ dī shí chuān*  
**Literal meaning:** Water drops pierce stone

## Origin & Usage

This idiom captures the power of persistence through the image of water (水) drops (滴) piercing (穿) stone (石). First documented in Han Dynasty texts, it was inspired by observations of natural cave formations created by centuries of dripping water. The imagery gained prominence during the Tang Dynasty as Buddhist teachers used it to illustrate the power of consistent practice in spiritual cultivation. During the Song Dynasty, it became associated with the imperial examination system, encouraging students to persist in their studies despite initial failures. Modern usage emphasizes that seemingly impossible goals can be achieved through consistent effort over time, particularly resonating in educational and personal development contexts.

## Examples

**English:** "With consistent practice, she finally mastered the difficult skill"

**Chinese:** 通过持续练习，她终于掌握了这项难度很大的技能
