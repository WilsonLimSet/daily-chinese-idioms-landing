**Pronunciation:** *xìn kǒu kāi hé*  
**Literal meaning:** Trust mouth open river

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes opening (开) a river (河) from one's trusted mouth (信口) - letting words flow freely without verification or thought. The image of a mouth releasing a torrent of water captures uncontrolled speech. The phrase appeared in Yuan Dynasty drama criticizing careless speakers. It warns against speaking without thinking or making claims without evidence. Modern usage criticizes those who speak irresponsibly, make unfounded statements, or exaggerate without regard for truth.

## Examples

**English:** "He tends to make things up without any evidence."

**Chinese:** 他经常信口开河，没有任何依据。
