**Pronunciation:** *rěn wú kě rěn*  
**Literal meaning:** Endure without possibility of enduring

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes enduring (忍) until there is nothing (无) left that can (可) be endured (忍). The repetition of 'ren' (忍, endure) emphasizes the limit being reached. Chinese culture values patience and forbearance, making this breaking point significant. The phrase appeared in texts describing moments when even the most patient person must act. Modern usage marks the threshold where tolerance ends and response becomes necessary.

## Examples

**English:** "After repeated offenses, his patience finally ran out."

**Chinese:** 在反复冒犯后，他终于忍无可忍。
