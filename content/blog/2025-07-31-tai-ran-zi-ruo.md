**Pronunciation:** *tài rán zì ruò*  
**Literal meaning:** Calm naturally as before

## Origin & Usage

This composed idiom describes remaining perfectly calm (泰然) and naturally (自) maintaining one's usual manner (若), originating from Han Dynasty philosophical texts. It first appeared in Daoist discussions of maintaining internal equilibrium regardless of external circumstances. The term 泰 specifically evoked the hexagram from the I Ching representing perfect harmony and peace. During the Wei-Jin period of political turmoil, it became associated with the cultivated indifference of scholarly recluses who maintained equanimity despite dangerous times. Unlike terms for simple calmness, it specifically emphasizes maintaining one's normal behavior during extraordinary circumstances. Modern usage celebrates unshakable composure under pressure, particularly in crisis situations where emotional stability enables effective action.

## Examples

**English:** "Despite the chaos around her, the surgeon performed the procedure with perfect composure"

**Chinese:** 尽管周围一片混乱，外科医生仍然泰然自若地进行手术
