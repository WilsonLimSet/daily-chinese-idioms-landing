**Pronunciation:** *zì lì gēng shēng*
**Literal meaning:** Self-strength regenerate life

## Origin & Usage

Buddhist concepts of spiritual self-regeneration took on powerful new meaning during China's early 20th century struggle for independence. This idea of using one's own strength (自力) to create renewed life (更生) became a national motto during the 1960s-70s when self-sufficiency was paramount. The phrase perfectly captured the determination to develop internal capabilities rather than rely on external support. Today it resonates from national policy to personal development, describing the creation of independent capabilities through internal resources.

## When to Use

**Situation:** After the economic embargo, the nation developed independent industrial capacity
