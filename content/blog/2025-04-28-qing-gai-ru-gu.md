## Origin & Usage

Dating to the Spring and Autumn period, this elegant idiom describes the instant rapport between kindred spirits, comparing it to tilting (倾) carriage covers (盖) while greeting as if (如) old (故) friends. The image comes from ancient Chinese road etiquette, where travelers would tilt their carriage covers to show respect when passing. Historical accounts mention how legendary friendships between scholars often began with such chance encounters. Modern usage celebrates the phenomenon of immediate connection between like-minded people, particularly in professional or intellectual contexts, emphasizing how authentic relationships can transcend formal social conventions.
