**Pronunciation:** *qī shǒu bā jiǎo*
**Literal meaning:** Seven hands eight feet

## Origin & Usage

Tang Dynasty temple construction projects gave birth to this vivid phrase describing numerous hands (七手) and feet (八脚) moving simultaneously. The image of multiple workers in confined spaces, creating organized chaos, resonated through the ages. Song Dynasty writers found humor in these scenes of well-intended but disorderly group efforts. Today, from emergency rooms to crisis management teams, it captures the energy of multiple people working together with more enthusiasm than coordination.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The emergency room staff moved in chaotic coordination to save the accident victim
