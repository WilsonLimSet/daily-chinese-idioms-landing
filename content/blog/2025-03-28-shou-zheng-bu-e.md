**Pronunciation:** *shǒu zhèng bù ē*  
**Literal meaning:** Keep right no flattery

## Origin & Usage

Emerging from Han Dynasty political discourse, this phrase combines maintaining righteousness (守正) with refusing to flatter or compromise principles (不阿). The term gained prominence during a period of intense political intrigue, where court officials faced pressure to abandon principles for personal gain. The character 阿 (flattery) originally depicted a person bending in submission, making the imagery particularly vivid. Contemporary usage celebrates ethical integrity in challenging situations, particularly in professional or political contexts where standing firm against corruption or unethical practices requires moral courage.

## Examples
