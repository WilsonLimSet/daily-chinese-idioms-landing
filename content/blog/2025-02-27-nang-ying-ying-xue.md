**Pronunciation:** *náng yíng yìng xuě*  
**Literal meaning:** Firefly in bag snow reflection

## Origin & Usage

This poetic idiom combines two classical stories of determined scholars: one who studied by the light of captured fireflies in a bag (囊萤), another who read by snow's reflection (映雪). Dating to the Jin Dynasty, these tales exemplified extraordinary dedication to learning despite poverty. The firefly scholar, Che Yin, couldn't afford oil for lamps, while Sun Kang utilized moonlight reflected off snow to read. Together, they created an enduring symbol of perseverance in pursuit of knowledge. Modern usage celebrates innovative solutions to resource limitations and serves as inspiration for students facing hardship, suggesting that determination can overcome material constraints.
