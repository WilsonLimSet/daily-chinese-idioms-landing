**Pronunciation:** *bàn xìn bàn yí*  
**Literal meaning:** Half believing half doubting

## Origin & Usage

This idiom precisely captures the state of partial belief (半信) mixed with partial doubt (半疑), describing uncertainty where one can neither fully accept nor completely reject something. The balanced structure of 'half-half' reflects the equilibrium of competing inclinations. The phrase appears in Ming Dynasty vernacular literature depicting characters receiving incredible news. It represents a mature, cautious response to uncertain information. Modern usage describes healthy skepticism or the natural state of processing unverified claims.

**English:** "She was skeptical about his explanation but couldn't dismiss it entirely."

**Chinese:** 她对他的解释半信半疑。
