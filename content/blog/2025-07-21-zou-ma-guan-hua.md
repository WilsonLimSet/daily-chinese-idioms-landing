**Pronunciation:** *zǒu mǎ guān huā*  
**Literal meaning:** View flowers from galloping horse

## Origin & Usage

This vivid idiom describes viewing (观) flowers (花) while riding (走) a galloping horse (马), originating from Tang Dynasty tourism practices. Historical records mention how imperial messengers or officials traveling quickly through regions could only glimpse scenes briefly before moving on. The image perfectly captured the inherent tension between motion and observation. During the Song Dynasty, it evolved into literary criticism, describing works that covered many topics without deep engagement. Unlike terms for simple carelessness, it acknowledges the constraints of time or circumstance that necessitate superficial engagement. Modern usage describes cursory experiences of all kinds, from rushed tourism to superficial learning, without necessarily implying negligence.

## Examples

**English:** "The three-day tour only allowed for a superficial impression of the ancient city"

**Chinese:** 为期三天的旅游只能对这座古城有一个肤浅的印象
