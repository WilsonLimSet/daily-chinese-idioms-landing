**Pronunciation:** *huì jí jì yī*  
**Literal meaning:** Conceal illness, avoid doctors

## Origin & Usage

This self-defeating idiom describes concealing (讳) illness (疾) and refusing (忌) medical treatment (医), originating from Han Dynasty historical records. It first described Emperor Wen's son who hid his illness for fear of appearing weak, ultimately dying from a treatable condition. During the Tang Dynasty, the phrase expanded beyond literal illness to describe concealing organizational or social problems rather than addressing them. The medical metaphor resonated deeply in Chinese culture, where acknowledging problems was traditionally seen as the first step toward solution. Modern usage criticizes refusing to acknowledge and address evident problems, particularly when fear of embarrassment or reputation damage prevents necessary intervention, often resulting in preventable escalation of difficulties.

## Examples

**English:** "The company refused to acknowledge its financial problems until bankruptcy was inevitable"

**Chinese:** 公司拒绝承认其财务问题，直到破产不可避免
