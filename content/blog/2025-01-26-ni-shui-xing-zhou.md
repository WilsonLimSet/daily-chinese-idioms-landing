**Pronunciation:** *nì shuǐ xíng zhōu*  
**Literal meaning:** Boat moving against current

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes a boat (舟) moving (行) against (逆) the current (水), originally appearing in Tang Dynasty texts discussing persistence in difficult endeavors. The metaphor draws from the experience of river traders who understood that stopping meant drifting backward. During the Song Dynasty, it gained particular significance in educational contexts, where scholars used it to encourage consistent effort in study. The image powerfully suggests that maintaining position against opposing forces requires constant effort. Modern usage emphasizes that progress against any opposing force - whether in personal development, business competition, or social reform - requires continuous effort to avoid regression.

## Examples

**English:** "In this competitive industry, you must keep improving or fall behind"
