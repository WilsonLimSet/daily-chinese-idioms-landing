**Pronunciation:** *tòng gǎi qián fēi*  
**Literal meaning:** Painfully change previous wrongs

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes painfully (痛) changing (改) one's previous (前) wrongs (非). The inclusion of 'tong' (痛, pain) suggests genuine remorse rather than superficial reform. The phrase appeared in texts about moral transformation and repentance. It values deep change born from sincere recognition of past errors. Modern usage describes genuine reform following wrongdoing, emphasizing the emotional and moral depth required for true change rather than mere behavioral adjustment.

## Examples

**English:** "After the incident, he resolved to completely change his ways."

**Chinese:** 事件之后，他决心痛改前非。
