**Pronunciation:** *dà qì wǎn chéng*  
**Literal meaning:** Great talents mature late

## Origin & Usage

This encouraging idiom suggests that significant talents or capacities (大器) often develop or succeed (成) late (晚). It originated during the Eastern Han Dynasty, appearing in the biography of statesman Yang Chen. After declining several official appointments, Yang explained that fine wood requires longer to season and superior vessels need more time to craft. The concept gained prominence during the Song Dynasty when it was used to reassure late-blooming scholars. Unlike idioms celebrating prodigies, this one specifically values development requiring extended maturation. Modern applications span career development, education, and personal growth, reminding us that significant accomplishments often emerge from lengthy preparation rather than early brilliance.

## Examples

**English:** "The writer published his masterpiece in his sixties after decades of developing his craft"

**Chinese:** 这位作家在六十多岁时出版了他的代表作，此前已经花了几十年磨练自己的技艺
