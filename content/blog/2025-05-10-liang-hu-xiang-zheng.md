**Pronunciation:** *liǎng hǔ xiāng zhēng*  
**Literal meaning:** Two tigers fight

## Origin & Usage

The image of two (两) tigers (虎) fighting (相争) comes from ancient observations of territorial conflicts, documented in early Chinese zoological texts. The original context appears in strategic texts discussing how such conflicts inevitably result in injury to both parties. The phrase gained prominence during the Warring States period as a metaphor for mutually destructive conflict between powerful states. Contemporary usage warns against destructive competition, particularly in business or politics, where fierce rivalry can damage both parties while benefiting opportunistic observers.

## Examples

**English:** "When the two star players fought for team leadership, it damaged team morale and performance"

**Chinese:** 当两位明星球员争夺队伍领导权时，损害了团队士气和表现
