**Pronunciation:** *bǎi fā bǎi zhòng*
**Literal meaning:** Hundred shots hundred hits

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from Tang Dynasty military assessments of elite archers who could hit the target (中) with every single shot (百发) fired. It first appeared in military texts describing the extraordinary precision achieved by master bowmen after decades of practice. During the Song Dynasty, it extended beyond archery to represent any consistently perfect performance. The quantification was particularly meaningful—'hundred' represented complete sets in Chinese numerology rather than literal counts. Unlike terms simply meaning 'accurate,' it emphasizes flawless perfection across multiple attempts. Modern usage spans sports performance to business decision-making, describing rare perfect consistency in environments where even small success rate variations significantly impact outcomes, particularly when sustained excellence distinguishes true masters from merely skilled practitioners.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The veteran investor made consistently successful decisions throughout the volatile market
