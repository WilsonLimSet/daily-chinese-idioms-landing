**Pronunciation:** *rú lǚ báo bīng*  
**Literal meaning:** Like walking on thin ice

## Origin & Usage

This cautious idiom describes moving as if (如) walking (履) on thin (薄) ice (冰), originating from the Book of Changes during the Zhou Dynasty. It appeared in discussions about how noble individuals should conduct themselves with constant awareness of potential danger despite appearing safe. The winter imagery created a vivid metaphor for situations requiring extreme caution where one misstep could prove disastrous. During the Han Dynasty, court advisors frequently used it to remind emperors about the precarious nature of power. Modern usage describes proceeding with extreme caution in hazardous situations, particularly contexts where apparent stability masks significant risk, teaching that vigilance often proves essential even when danger isn't immediately visible.

## Examples

**English:** "The negotiation team proceeded cautiously through the delicate diplomatic situation"
