**Pronunciation:** *xīn xuè lái cháo*
**Literal meaning:** Heart's blood comes in a tide

## Origin & Usage

This idiom comes from traditional Chinese medicine concepts where the heart (心) was believed to govern blood (血) circulation and emotions. When blood rushes to the heart like a tide (潮), it was thought to cause sudden impulses or inspirations. The phrase gained literary currency during the Ming Dynasty in novels describing characters acting on sudden urges. In modern usage, it describes impulsive decisions or sudden whims, carrying a neutral to slightly cautionary tone about acting without deliberation.

## When to Use

**Situation:** On a whim, she decided to book a flight to Paris.
