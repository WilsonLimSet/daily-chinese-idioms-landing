## Origin & Usage

The story of Jin Dynasty official Xie An, who retreated to East Mountain (东山) before making a triumphant return to high office, gave us this enduring image of strategic withdrawal followed by powerful comeback. Tang Dynasty historians transformed his specific experience into a broader pattern of career revival. The mountain imagery perfectly captured both retreat and elevation, suggesting how temporary withdrawal often enables eventual ascension.
