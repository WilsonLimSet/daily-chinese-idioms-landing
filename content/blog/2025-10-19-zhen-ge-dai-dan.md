## Origin & Usage

Among the ancient verses of the 'Book of Songs' (1000-600 BCE), this image of soldiers using spears as pillows (枕戈) while awaiting dawn (待旦) captured the essence of vigilant readiness. The concept of sacrificing comfort for security resonated deeply in ancient Chinese military thought. Han Dynasty texts elevated it to a principle of military preparedness.
