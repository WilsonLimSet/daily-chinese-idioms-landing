## Origin & Usage

Originally appearing in the Classic of Poetry, this idiom references the painstaking process of jade (玉) craftsmanship, where the stone becomes (成) perfected through careful work (汝). Ancient craftsmen observed that jade's true beauty emerged only through patient, deliberate cultivation. During the Song Dynasty, Neo-Confucian scholars adopted it as a metaphor for character development. Modern usage applies to any process requiring patience and dedication to reveal inherent potential, whether in education, personal growth, or artistic development. It emphasizes how excellence emerges through persistent refinement rather than sudden transformation.
