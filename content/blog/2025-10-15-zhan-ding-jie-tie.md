**Pronunciation:** *zhǎn dīng jié tiě*
**Literal meaning:** Chop nail cut iron

## Origin & Usage

Born in the workshops of Tang Dynasty metalworkers, this phrase captures the clean, decisive action of chopping nails (斩钉) and cutting iron (截铁). The imagery demands absolute commitment - hesitation ruins both material and tools. Song Dynasty administrators adopted it to describe unequivocal decision-making, where clarity outweighs nuance. In contemporary usage, it describes decisions and actions that, like cutting metal, must be executed with singular purpose and no possibility of reversal.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The judge made a decisive ruling that left no room for appeal or interpretation
