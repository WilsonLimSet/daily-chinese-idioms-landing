**Pronunciation:** *hú lún tūn zǎo*  
**Literal meaning:** Swallow dates whole

## Origin & Usage

This digestive idiom describes swallowing (吞) jujube dates (枣) whole (囫囵) without proper chewing, originating from Song Dynasty educational texts. It first appeared in critiques of students who memorized classical texts without understanding their meaning. The specific reference to dates was meaningful as these common fruits were known for their wrinkled complexity, containing multiple layers of flavor and a central pit that required careful consumption. During the Ming Dynasty, the phrase became standard terminology in scholarly criticism. Unlike terms for simple carelessness, it specifically describes superficial engagement with material requiring deeper processing. Modern usage criticizes rote learning without comprehension, particularly in educational contexts where memorization might substitute for understanding.

## Examples

**English:** "The student memorized the formulas without understanding the underlying principles"

**Chinese:** 学生死记硬背公式，而不理解基本原理
