## Origin & Usage

This idiom advises thinking of (思) danger (危) while dwelling in (居) peace (安). It comes from 'Zuozhuan,' an ancient Chinese chronicle, warning against complacency during good times. The phrase embodies the wisdom of preparation and foresight. Chinese history provided many examples of kingdoms that fell because they grew complacent. Modern usage encourages vigilance and contingency planning even when circumstances seem favorable.
