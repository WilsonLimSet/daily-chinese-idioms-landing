**Pronunciation:** *wén jī qǐ wǔ*  
**Literal meaning:** Hear rooster rise dance

## Origin & Usage

This inspiring idiom recalls the story of Zu Di, a Jin Dynasty general who would rise (起) to practice sword dance (舞) whenever he heard (闻) roosters (鸡) crow. His daily pre-dawn dedication ultimately led to military excellence. The rooster's call, traditionally marking daybreak, became a symbol of self-motivated discipline. The practice spread among ambitious young officers, creating a cultural tradition of early-morning cultivation of skills. Modern usage encourages proactive self-improvement and represents the discipline required for achievement, particularly emphasizing the value of establishing productive daily routines.

## Examples

**English:** "She practiced piano every morning before dawn to master her craft"
