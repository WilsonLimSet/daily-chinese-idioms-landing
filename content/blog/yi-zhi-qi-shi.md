## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes commanding others with chin (颐) gestures (指) and breathing (气) to direct (使). It depicts someone so arrogant they give orders through mere facial expressions and sighs rather than words. This behavior was associated with tyrannical masters commanding servants. Modern usage criticizes bossy, imperious behavior that treats others as beneath verbal communication.
