## Origin & Usage

Tang Dynasty theater directors first used this vivid image of anger as fire (火) rising (冒) three zhang (三丈) high - about 10 meters - in stage directions. Actors were instructed to physically manifest rage at this scale to convey its overwhelming nature. Ming Dynasty writers brought this theatrical metaphor into literature, where it perfectly captured those moments when provocation creates an explosive emotional response visible to all observers.
