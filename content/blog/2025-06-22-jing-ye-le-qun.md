**Pronunciation:** *jìng yè lè qún*  
**Literal meaning:** Respect work enjoy community

## Origin & Usage

This balanced approach advocates respecting (敬) one's profession (业) while enjoying (乐) community (群), first appearing in Confucian educational texts during the Han Dynasty. It emerged from Confucius's teaching that ideal scholars should be both diligent in their studies and harmonious in relationships. The specific pairing reflected the belief that individual excellence and social connection reinforced each other. During the Song Dynasty, it became a standard evaluation criterion for imperial officials. Unlike idioms focusing solely on individual achievement or social skills, it emphasizes their complementary nature. Modern usage describes model professionals who maintain both technical excellence and collaborative abilities - increasingly valued in knowledge economy organizations.
