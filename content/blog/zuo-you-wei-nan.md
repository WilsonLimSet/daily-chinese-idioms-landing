## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes being in difficulty (为难) whether going left (左) or right (右), trapped between two equally problematic choices. The spatial metaphor of being stuck between opposing directions vividly captures the experience of dilemmas. The phrase appeared in historical texts describing officials caught between conflicting loyalties or commanders facing impossible tactical situations. It embodies situations where every option carries significant costs. Modern usage describes any predicament where all available choices present serious difficulties.
