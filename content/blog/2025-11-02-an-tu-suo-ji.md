**Pronunciation:** *àn tú suǒ jì*
**Literal meaning:** Follow map seek fine horse

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from the 'Han Feizi' text of the Warring States period, telling of a man seeking an exceptional steed named Ji using only an old drawing, failing because the living horse had changed. During the Tang Dynasty, it became shorthand for rigid methodology ignoring changed realities. Following a map (按图) to search for a legendary horse (索骥) was a particularly resonant metaphor in Chinese culture where fine horses represented rare excellence with dynamic, evolving qualities. Unlike terms simply meaning 'obsolete,' it specifically criticizes over-reliance on fixed information when pursuing dynamic targets. Modern usage spans business strategy to scientific research, describing approaches that fail by rigidly applying outdated methods to evolving situations, particularly when flexibility and adaptation would better serve pursuit objectives.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The investors relied on outdated market research to find opportunities in the rapidly evolving technology sector
