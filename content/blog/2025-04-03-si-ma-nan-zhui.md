**Pronunciation:** *sì mǎ nán zhuī*  
**Literal meaning:** Four horses can't catch

## Origin & Usage

Originally from the Spring and Autumn period, this phrase describes how even four (驷) horses (马) cannot catch (难追) spoken words once uttered. The image of a four-horse chariot - the fastest vehicle of ancient China - emphasizes the irreversible nature of speech. The idiom gained particular significance during the Warring States period, where diplomatic communications could determine the fate of kingdoms. Today, it serves as a reminder about the power and permanence of words, particularly relevant in our age of instant digital communication.

## Examples

**English:** "He carefully considered his public statement, knowing its impact would be irreversible"

**Chinese:** 他仔细考虑自己的公开声明，知道其影响将不可逆转
