**Pronunciation:** *zuò huái bù luàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Sit in lap not disorderly

## Origin & Usage

This idiom refers to maintaining propriety (不乱) even when a woman sits (坐) in one's lap (怀), originating from a story about Confucian scholar Liuxia Hui during the Spring and Autumn period. Historical texts recount how he once held a freezing woman in his arms to save her life, yet maintained perfect moral restraint. During the Han Dynasty, the story became a classic example of moral strength overcoming physical temptation. The specific imagery highlighted the extreme test of virtue, making the restraint more impressive. Modern usage describes professional integrity in situations of potential impropriety, especially in positions of trust like healthcare, education, or counseling, where maintaining boundaries is essential.

## Examples

**English:** "The respected doctor maintained perfect professionalism with all patients"
