**Literal meaning:** People mountain people sea

## Origin & Usage

This crowded idiom describes people (人) forming mountains (山) and seas (海) through their sheer numbers, originating from Song Dynasty urban descriptions. It first appeared in accounts of imperial capital festivals where vast crowds gathered. The geographical metaphor created a powerful image of human density so great that individuals formed topographical features. During the Ming Dynasty, as urbanization increased, it became common in descriptions of city markets and gatherings. Unlike terms for simple crowds, it specifically emphasizes overwhelming scale beyond normal comprehension. Modern usage describes extremely dense gatherings where individual distinction disappears into collective mass, particularly at major events, popular attractions, or urban centers where human concentration reaches extraordinary levels.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The famous tourist site was filled with countless visitors during the holiday
