**Pronunciation:** *wù jí bì fǎn*  
**Literal meaning:** Things at extreme reverse

## Origin & Usage

This idiom captures a fundamental principle of Chinese philosophy: when things (物) reach their extreme (极), they inevitably (必) reverse (反). First articulated in the I Ching, it reflects observations of natural cycles like the changing seasons. During the Warring States period, strategists applied this principle to military and political planning, warning against pushing advantages too far. The concept gained renewed significance during the Song Dynasty as Neo-Confucian scholars integrated it into their understanding of social and moral dynamics. Modern usage serves as a reminder about the dangers of extremes in any context - from business cycles and social movements to personal behavior patterns.

## Examples

**English:** "After the market peaked, a correction was inevitable"

**Chinese:** 市场达到顶峰后，调整是不可避免的
