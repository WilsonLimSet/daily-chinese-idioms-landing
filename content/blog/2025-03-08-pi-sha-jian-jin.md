**Pronunciation:** *pī shā jiǎn jīn*  
**Literal meaning:** Sift sand pick gold

## Origin & Usage

This idiom emerged from gold panning techniques along ancient China's river systems, where sifting (披) through sand (沙) to pick out (拣) gold (金) required patience and discernment. Originally used in Han Dynasty texts to describe the careful evaluation of historical documents, it gained prominence during the Song Dynasty's revival of classical scholarship. The metaphor captured both the tedious nature of the work and the value of the discoveries. Modern usage applies to any careful selection process - from research methodology to talent recruitment - where finding value requires sorting through abundant but less valuable material.

## Examples

**English:** "The talent scout had a knack for finding promising athletes in small rural schools"

**Chinese:** 星探有在小乡村学校发现有潜力运动员的独特能力
