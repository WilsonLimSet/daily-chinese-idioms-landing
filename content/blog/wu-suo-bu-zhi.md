**Pronunciation:** *wú suǒ bù zhī*  
**Literal meaning:** Nothing that is not known

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes a state where there is nothing (无所) that is not (不) known (知) - omniscience or encyclopedic knowledge. The phrase originally described divine or sage-like understanding. While no human truly knows everything, the expression praises exceptionally broad knowledge. Modern usage often carries slight exaggeration or humor when describing well-informed individuals, though it can also be used more seriously for true polymaths or in religious contexts.

## Examples

**English:** "She seems to have knowledge about every subject."

**Chinese:** 她似乎无所不知。
