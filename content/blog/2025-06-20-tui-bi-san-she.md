**Pronunciation:** *tuì bì sān shè*  
**Literal meaning:** Retreat three camps

## Origin & Usage

This strategic idiom describes voluntarily retreating (退避) three (三) camp-distances (舍) to avoid conflict, originating from the Spring and Autumn period. It stems from Duke Wen of Jin's famous decision to withdraw his army three stations before confronting the Chu forces, demonstrating magnanimity that ultimately helped him win allies. The specific measure 'shè' (舍) represented the distance armies could march in a day, making this a significant territorial concession. During the Han Dynasty, the phrase became shorthand for enlightened strategic withdrawal. Unlike terms for simple retreat, it suggests a deliberate yielding from a position of strength. Modern usage describes graceful compromise or strategic concession to achieve greater long-term advantages.
