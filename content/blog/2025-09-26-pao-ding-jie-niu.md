**Pronunciation:** *páo dīng jiě niú*  
**Literal meaning:** Chef Ding butchers ox

## Origin & Usage

This idiom comes from Zhuangzi's famous 4th century BCE parable about Cook Ding (庖丁) skillfully butchering an ox (解牛). The story tells of him explaining to his lord how decades of practice led him beyond mere visual guidance to intuitive mastery. During the Han Dynasty, the tale became a standard metaphor for administrative skill. The image of the blade finding natural spaces between bones resonated particularly in Chinese culture, where meat preparation was both vital and technically demanding. Modern usage describes the highest levels of skill in any domain, where expertise becomes so internalized it appears effortless.

## When to Use

**Situation:** After thirty years of practice, the surgeon performed complex operations with effortless precision
