**Pronunciation:** *wú dòng yú zhōng*  
**Literal meaning:** No movement in the heart

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes having no (无) movement (动) within (于) one's heart (衷). The character 衷 specifically refers to the innermost feelings. The phrase can describe either admirable composure and self-control or, more negatively, cold indifference to situations that should evoke response. Context determines whether the lack of emotional reaction is praised or criticized. Modern usage often describes apathy or indifference, though it can also describe appropriate emotional restraint in certain contexts.

## Examples

**English:** "He remained unmoved by all the emotional appeals."

**Chinese:** 面对所有情感诉求，他无动于衷。
