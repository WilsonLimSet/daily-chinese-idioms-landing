## Origin & Usage

This idiom appears in the ancient Daoist text 'Zhuangzi' and was used by Confucius to criticize those who considered themselves (自以为) always right (是). The phrase critiques the dangerous combination of confidence and closed-mindedness. In Chinese philosophical tradition, true wisdom requires humility and openness to correction. The idiom warns against the intellectual arrogance that prevents growth and learning. Modern usage describes someone who is opinionated, self-righteous, or unwilling to consider alternative viewpoints.
