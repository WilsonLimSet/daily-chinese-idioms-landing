**Pronunciation:** *bù qū bù náo*  
**Literal meaning:** Neither bend nor yield

## Origin & Usage

This idiom combines two negations - not (不) bending (屈) and not (不) yielding (挠) - to describe absolute resistance to pressure. The phrase appears in historical texts praising martyrs and heroes who maintained their principles despite threats or torture. The double negation creates emphasis, suggesting complete imperviousness to coercion. It embodies the Confucian virtue of unwavering integrity and the Chinese cultural admiration for those who suffer rather than compromise. Modern usage praises determination and resilience in facing adversity.

## Examples

**English:** "Her indomitable spirit helped her overcome every obstacle."

**Chinese:** 她不屈不挠的精神帮助她克服了每一个障碍。
