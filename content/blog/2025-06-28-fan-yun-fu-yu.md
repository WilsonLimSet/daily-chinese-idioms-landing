**Pronunciation:** *fān yún fù yǔ*  
**Literal meaning:** 翻Turn clouds overturn rain

## Origin & Usage

This meteorological metaphor describes the ability to turn over (翻) clouds (云) and overturn (覆) rain (雨), originating from Daoist rain-making rituals of the Warring States period. It first described shamans believed capable of manipulating weather through magical practices. During the Tang Dynasty, it evolved to describe powerful officials who could dramatically alter circumstances. The weather imagery was particularly meaningful in agricultural societies where rainfall determined prosperity. By the Qing Dynasty, it had acquired negative connotations, suggesting capricious or manipulative behavior. Modern usage typically describes unpredictable, dramatic reversals - particularly when powerful figures suddenly change positions or policies to serve their interests.

## Examples

**English:** "The politician completely reversed his position after winning the election"
