**Pronunciation:** *pī xīng dài yuè*  
**Literal meaning:** Wear stars crown moon

## Origin & Usage

This poetic idiom paints a picture of wearing (披) stars (星) and crowning (戴) oneself with the moon (月), describing dedication that extends from dawn to dusk. It originated from descriptions of diligent scholars during the Tang Dynasty who studied through the night. Historical records note how successful imperial examination candidates would often maintain such demanding schedules. Contemporary usage honors those who work tirelessly toward their goals, particularly in academic or professional pursuits, while maintaining the original's sense of sacrifice and dedication without glorifying overwork.
