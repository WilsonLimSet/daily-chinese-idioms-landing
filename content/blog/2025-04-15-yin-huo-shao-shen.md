**Pronunciation:** *yǐn huǒ shāo shēn*  
**Literal meaning:** Draw fire burn self

## Origin & Usage

This cautionary idiom describes the act of drawing (引) fire (火) to burn (烧) oneself (身), originating from the Spring and Autumn period. It first appeared in historical accounts of conspirators who, in attempting to harm others, ultimately destroyed themselves. The metaphor draws from ancient Chinese firefighting wisdom, where creating firebreaks often risked spreading the flames instead. During the Tang Dynasty, it became a standard warning in political discourse about the dangers of revenge plots. The concept gained additional significance during the Song Dynasty, where it was often cited in legal commentaries about retributive justice. Modern usage applies to situations where attempts to harm others backfire, particularly in business or political contexts where aggressive tactics can lead to self-destruction, serving as a reminder that malicious actions often return to their source.
