## Origin & Usage

Originating from ancient Chinese village organization principles, this phrase describes communities watching (守望) and helping (相助) each other. Historical records from the Zhou Dynasty detail how five families would form mutual aid groups, sharing lookout duties and agricultural assistance. The concept proved so effective it was incorporated into formal administrative systems during the Han Dynasty. Today, it represents the enduring value of community solidarity and mutual support, particularly in times of hardship.
