**Pronunciation:** *chū lèi bá cuì*  
**Literal meaning:** Rise above the crowd

## Origin & Usage

This distinguished idiom describes emerging (出) from a category (类) and rising above (拔) the crowd (萃), originating from the Book of Later Han. It first described officials whose exceptional talents distinguished them from colleagues. The agricultural metaphor suggests a plant growing noticeably taller than surrounding vegetation, drawing from farming imagery familiar in Chinese society. During the Tang Dynasty, imperial examination reports adopted it to identify truly remarkable candidates. Unlike terms for simple superiority, it specifically emphasizes natural excellence that becomes self-evident through comparison. Modern usage identifies individuals whose abilities or achievements significantly surpass their peer group, particularly in competitive fields where meaningful differentiation requires substantial superiority.

## When to Use
