**Pronunciation:** *jǔ zhòng ruò qīng*  
**Literal meaning:** Lift heavy as light

## Origin & Usage

This idiom reflects a masterful approach to difficult tasks, where lifting (举) something heavy (重) appears (若) as effortless as something light (轻). It originates from Daoist philosophy, particularly Zhuangzi's writings on the concept of effortless action (无为). The image of a skilled practitioner making challenging feats seem easy was often used to describe both physical and mental mastery. In traditional martial arts, it exemplified the highest level of skill where power is achieved through technique rather than brute force. Modern usage extends to any situation where expertise allows complex challenges to be handled with apparent ease - from diplomatic negotiations to artistic performances.

## Examples

**English:** "The senior diplomat handled the crisis with apparent ease"

**Chinese:** 资深外交官从容应对危机
