**Pronunciation:** *sì hǎi wéi jiā*  
**Literal meaning:** Four seas become home

## Origin & Usage

Emerging during the Han Dynasty's period of expansion, this cosmopolitan idiom envisions the four seas (四海) becoming one's home (家). It reflected the era's growing international trade and cultural exchange along the Silk Road. Historical texts praise diplomats and merchants who could adapt to diverse cultures while maintaining their own identity. Modern usage celebrates global citizenship and cultural adaptability, particularly relevant in our interconnected world. It suggests both the adventurous spirit of exploring beyond one's origins and the ability to feel at home anywhere.
