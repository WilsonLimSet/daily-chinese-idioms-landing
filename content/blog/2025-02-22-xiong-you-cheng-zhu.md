**Pronunciation:** *xiōng yǒu chéng zhú*  
**Literal meaning:** Bamboo ready in heart

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from Southern Song Dynasty painter Wen Yuke's approach to bamboo painting. Before touching brush to paper, he would completely visualize the bamboo (竹) in his heart/mind (胸), ensuring it was fully formed (成) in his imagination. The practice exemplified the Chinese artistic principle of mental preparation before execution. Modern usage extends far beyond art to any situation requiring thorough mental preparation - from business presentations to athletic performances. It emphasizes the importance of clear visualization and mental readiness before taking action.
