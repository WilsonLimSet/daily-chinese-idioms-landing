**Pronunciation:** *ài bù shì shǒu*
**Literal meaning:** Love not release hand

## Origin & Usage

Song Dynasty connoisseurs first used this phrase to describe loving something so much (爱) one cannot (不) release (释) it from hand (手). Their writings captured that special attachment collectors feel toward precious artifacts. Ming Dynasty poets expanded it to embrace emotional attachments beyond physical objects. The tactile metaphor perfectly captures how physical reluctance to release reflects deeper psychological attachment. Modern usage spans from art appreciation to emotional bonds, describing attractions so intense they manifest in physical inability to let go.

## When to Use

**Situation:** She couldn't put down the antique jade pendant, examining it from every angle
