**Pronunciation:** *bèn niǎo xiān fēi*  
**Literal meaning:** Slow bird flies first

## Origin & Usage

This disarmingly simple idiom emerged from folk wisdom observing that slow (笨) birds (鸟) must start first (先飞) to reach their destination with the flock. During the Song Dynasty, it gained prominence in educational texts as encouragement for students who weren't naturally gifted. The imagery challenges the notion that innate talent determines success, instead emphasizing early preparation and persistent effort. In modern education and professional contexts, it advocates for proactive approaches to compensate for perceived disadvantages. The idiom particularly resonates in competitive environments where early preparation can level the playing field, teaching that consciousness of one's limitations can become a surprising advantage.
