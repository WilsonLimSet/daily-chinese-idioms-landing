**Pronunciation:** *gāo shān liú shuǐ*  
**Literal meaning:** High mountain flowing water

## Origin & Usage

This aesthetic idiom pairs lofty (高) mountains (山) with flowing (流) water (水), originating from a famous friendship between Zhong Ziqi and musician Bo Ya during the Spring and Autumn period. Historical texts recount how Bo Ya would play his qin while Zhong Ziqi perfectly understood his musical intentions - when Bo Ya thought of high mountains, Zhong would say so without being told. After Zhong's death, Bo reportedly never played again, having lost his perfect audience. During the Tang Dynasty, the phrase became shorthand for ideal artistic communication and profound friendship. Modern usage celebrates perfect understanding between people, particularly in artistic or intellectual partnerships where deep mutual comprehension transcends explicit explanation.

## Examples

**English:** "The virtuoso's performance demonstrated perfect artistic harmony and expression"
