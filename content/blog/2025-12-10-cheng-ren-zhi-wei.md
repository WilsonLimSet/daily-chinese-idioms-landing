**Pronunciation:** *chéng rén zhī wēi*
**Literal meaning:** Ride person's danger

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty military treatises first condemned this practice of taking advantage (乘) of others' moments of vulnerability (危). Tang Dynasty Confucian scholars expanded it into a broader ethical principle. The metaphor of 'mounting' someone's difficulty suggested using their misfortune as a stepping stone for personal gain. Contemporary business ethics still wrestle with questions of when competitive advantage crosses into exploitation.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The competitor offered an unfairly low buyout price during the company's financial crisis
