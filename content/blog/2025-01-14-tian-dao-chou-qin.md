**Pronunciation:** *tiān dào chóu qín*  
**Literal meaning:** Heaven's way rewards diligence

## Origin & Usage

This idiom encapsulates the belief that Heaven's way (天道) rewards (酬) diligence (勤). Emerging from Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian teachings, it reflects the synthesis of cosmic order with human effort. The concept challenged both fatalistic acceptance and the belief in pure luck, suggesting instead that the universe naturally responds to sincere effort. During the Ming Dynasty, it became particularly associated with the imperial examination system, encouraging scholars through years of difficult study. Modern usage extends beyond academic contexts to any field requiring persistent effort, suggesting that dedicated work aligns with natural laws of success. It offers both encouragement and philosophical justification for maintaining diligence despite delayed results.

## Examples

**English:** "Her years of hard work finally paid off with a major breakthrough"
