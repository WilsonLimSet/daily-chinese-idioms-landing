**Pronunciation:** *qīng méi zhú mǎ*  
**Literal meaning:** Green plums and bamboo horses

## Origin & Usage

This nostalgic idiom pairs green plums (青梅) with bamboo horses (竹马), originating from Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai's verse about childhood playmates. It described children gathering plums while riding makeshift hobby horses crafted from bamboo—a common children's game in ancient China. The specific imagery created a perfect metaphor for innocent childhood companionship, often with romantic potential. During the Song Dynasty, it evolved to specifically describe childhood sweethearts or lifelong companions who knew each other from an early age. Modern usage evokes the special bond between those who grew up together, particularly childhood friendships that develop into romantic relationships, capturing the unique intimacy and shared history of those who have known each other through life's earliest stages.

## Examples

**English:** "The couple had known each other since early childhood, playing together in their village"
