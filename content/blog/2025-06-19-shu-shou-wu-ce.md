**Pronunciation:** *shù shǒu wú cè*  
**Literal meaning:** Bind hands no strategy

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes the state of having bound (束) hands (手) with no (无) available strategies (策), originating from Spring and Autumn period military texts. It first appeared in historical accounts of surrounded armies without escape routes or battle plans. The physical image of bound hands vividly conveys the psychological experience of constraint and helplessness. During the Song Dynasty, it gained wider usage in political discourse, describing administrative situations with no viable policy options. Unlike idioms describing simple difficulty, it suggests complete absence of available solutions. Modern usage describes situations where even experts find themselves without workable approaches, particularly in unprecedented crises where experience provides no guidance.

## Examples

**English:** "The management team was completely helpless when facing the unprecedented crisis"

**Chinese:** 管理团队在面对这场前所未有的危机时束手无策
