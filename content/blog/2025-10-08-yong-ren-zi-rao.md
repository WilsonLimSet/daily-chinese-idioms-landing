**Pronunciation:** *yōng rén zì rǎo*
**Literal meaning:** Mediocre person self-disturbs

## Origin & Usage

This psychological idiom describes how unremarkable people (庸人) trouble themselves (自扰) with imagined concerns, originating from Ming Dynasty philosopher Wang Yangming's writings. He observed how ordinary minds generate unnecessary suffering through excessive rumination. The phrase gained popularity during the Qing Dynasty in literary works examining human folly. The identification with mediocrity was particularly meaningful in Confucian culture, suggesting superior minds avoid such self-created anxiety. Modern usage describes the universal human tendency to generate psychological distress without external causes, particularly relevant in today's anxiety-prone society.

## When to Use

**Situation:** She created imaginary problems and spent days worrying about scenarios that never materialized
