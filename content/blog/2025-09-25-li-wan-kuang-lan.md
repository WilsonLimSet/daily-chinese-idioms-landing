**Pronunciation:** *lì wǎn kuáng lán*  
**Literal meaning:** Pull back raging tides

## Origin & Usage

Born from Song Dynasty accounts of flood control efforts, this idiom describes using strength (力) to pull back (挽) wild (狂) tidal waves (澜). It first honored officials who prevented natural disasters through extraordinary measures. During the Ming Dynasty, historical chronicles applied it to administrators who prevented political or economic collapse through decisive action. The water imagery powerfully conveyed both the destructive potential of unchecked forces and the possibility of human intervention. Modern usage celebrates successful crisis management - from corporate turnarounds to environmental rescue efforts.

## When to Use
