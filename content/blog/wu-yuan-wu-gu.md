**Literal meaning:** No connection no reason

## Origin & Usage

Buddhist concepts of karmic relationships introduced this phrase describing actions having neither connection (无缘) nor cause (无故). Tang Dynasty writers brought it beyond religious contexts into everyday use. Song Dynasty legal documents adopted it to describe actions lacking apparent motivation. The double negation - eliminating both relationship and rational bases - creates a comprehensive sense of groundlessness that remains useful in modern legal and interpersonal contexts.

## When to Use
