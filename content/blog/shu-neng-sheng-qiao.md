## Origin & Usage

This idiom states that familiarity/practice (熟) can (能) produce (生) skill (巧). It emphasizes that expertise comes from repeated practice rather than innate talent alone. The phrase originated from a Song Dynasty story about an oil seller who could pour oil through a coin's hole - not from genius, but from practice. Modern usage encourages persistence in learning, affirming that mastery comes through dedicated repetition and experience.
