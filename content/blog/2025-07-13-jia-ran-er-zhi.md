**Pronunciation:** *jiá rán ér zhǐ*  
**Literal meaning:** Suddenly and stop

## Origin & Usage

This onomatopoeic idiom combines the sharp sound 'jia' (戛) with the character for 'thus' (然) and 'stop' (止), creating a vivid image of sudden cessation, originating from Han Dynasty music criticism. It first described performances where instruments stopped unexpectedly, breaking musical flow. The harsh consonant beginning matched the jarring experience of unexpected endings. During the Tang Dynasty, literary critics expanded its usage to describe narrative works with abrupt conclusions. The sound symbolism was particularly effective in Chinese aesthetics, where sonic qualities often reinforced meaning. Modern usage describes any unexpected termination - from interrupted conversations to discontinued projects - emphasizing both the suddenness and completeness of the cessation.

## Examples

**English:** "The music ended abruptly in the middle of the performance"

**Chinese:** 音乐在演出中突然戛然而止
