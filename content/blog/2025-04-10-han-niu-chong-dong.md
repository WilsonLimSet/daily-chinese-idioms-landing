**Pronunciation:** *hàn niú chōng dòng*  
**Literal meaning:** Sweat ox fill house

## Origin & Usage

Originally describing the vast quantity of books that would make an ox sweat (汗牛) from carrying them and fill (充) entire buildings (栋), this Tang Dynasty idiom emerged from descriptions of imperial libraries and private collections. The metaphor of sweating oxen straining under loads of books and buildings packed with texts emphasized both the physical mass of classical learning and its overwhelming scope. It gained particular currency during the Song Dynasty's revival of learning, when private libraries began to rival imperial collections. The phrase appears in numerous scholars' descriptions of famous collections, including those of the Yongle Encyclopedia project. Contemporary usage describes any impressive collection or body of work, particularly in academic or cultural contexts, emphasizing both quantity and quality.

## Examples

**English:** "The professor's research publications filled entire library shelves"
