**Pronunciation:** *xuě zhōng sòng tàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Send coal in snow

## Origin & Usage

Sending (送) coal (炭) in snow (雪) weather captured the essence of timely assistance during critical moments. This Song Dynasty idiom arose from stories of wealthy merchants who distributed fuel to poor families during harsh winters, when coal prices typically soared beyond reach. The image of dark coal against white snow created a striking visual metaphor for meaningful help rather than superficial gesture. Historical records praise officials and merchants who practiced this form of targeted charity, contrasting it with less practical forms of assistance. The idiom gained additional significance during the Ming Dynasty's severe winters, when fuel distribution became a critical aspect of local governance. Contemporary usage praises those who provide practical assistance exactly when needed, rather than offering unnecessary help in good times.

## Examples

**English:** "The timely loan helped the company survive the economic crisis"
