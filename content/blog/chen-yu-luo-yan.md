**Pronunciation:** *chén yú luò yàn*
**Literal meaning:** Sink fish fall geese

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty legends tell of beauty so extraordinary it caused fish to sink (沉鱼) and flying geese to descend (落雁). The phrase combines two legendary beauties: Xi Shi, whose reflection mesmerized fish into forgetting to swim, and Wang Zhaojun, whose appearance caused migrating geese to pause mid-flight. The power of beauty to disrupt even natural behavior suggested an almost supernatural level of impact. Modern usage describes beauty that creates an immediate, profound impact beyond mere aesthetic appreciation.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The legendary beauty attracted admiring glances wherever she appeared
