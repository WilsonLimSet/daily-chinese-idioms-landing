**Pronunciation:** *ān rú tài shān*
**Literal meaning:** Stable like Mount Tai

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from Han Dynasty political discourse about dynastic security, first appearing in imperial edicts describing the desired permanence of imperial rule. During the Tang Dynasty, it extended beyond political contexts to describe any unshakable entity. The comparison of being stable (安) like (如) Mount Tai (泰山), China's most revered mountain, was particularly powerful as Mount Tai represented China's most sacred peak, symbol of permanence and divine authority. Unlike terms simply meaning 'stable,' it specifically invokes both physical impregnability and spiritual significance. Modern usage spans financial institutions to emotional resilience, describing entities so fundamentally stable they remain unmoved by forces that would destabilize others, particularly when reputation for reliability becomes self-reinforcing through demonstrated consistency during challenging circumstances.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Even during the financial crisis, the company's position remained rock-solid
