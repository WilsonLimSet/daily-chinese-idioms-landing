**Literal meaning:** Draw snake add feet

## Origin & Usage

The ancient parable tells of an artist who lost a wine-drinking contest because he spent extra time adding legs to his snake drawing (画蛇添足). The story entered common usage during the Han Dynasty as a warning against ruining sufficiency through unnecessary additions. Today it reminds us how overelaboration often diminishes rather than enhances.
