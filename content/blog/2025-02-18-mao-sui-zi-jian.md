**Pronunciation:** *máo suì zì jiàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Mao Sui recommends himself

## Origin & Usage

Named after Mao Sui (毛遂), a lesser official from the Warring States period (475-221 BCE) who boldly recommended (荐) himself (自) for a crucial diplomatic mission. Despite his low rank, he demonstrated such eloquence and courage that he successfully secured an alliance for his state. The story reflects the merit-based aspects of ancient Chinese bureaucracy, where talent could theoretically transcend social status. In modern usage, it describes proactive self-promotion or volunteering for challenges, particularly when breaking traditional hierarchies or protocols. The idiom carries a positive connotation, suggesting confidence backed by genuine ability rather than mere arrogance.

## Examples

**English:** "When no one else stepped forward, she boldly volunteered to lead the difficult project"

**Chinese:** 当没有人愿意站出来时，她主动请缨领导这个困难的项目
