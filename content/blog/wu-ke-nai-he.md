## Origin & Usage

This idiom appears in early Chinese philosophical texts and gained literary fame through the Song Dynasty poet Yan Shu's famous line about falling flowers. The phrase expresses the feeling of being without (无) any possible (可) way to cope (奈何) with a situation. It captures the universal human experience of helplessness before circumstances beyond one's control, whether natural forces, fate, or the passage of time. Modern usage expresses resignation and acceptance when facing insurmountable obstacles or inevitable outcomes.
