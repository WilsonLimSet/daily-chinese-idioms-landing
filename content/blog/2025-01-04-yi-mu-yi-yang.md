**Pronunciation:** *yī mú yī yàng*  
**Literal meaning:** One mold one appearance

## Origin & Usage

Originating in Ming Dynasty craftsmen's guilds, this idiom literally means one (一) mold (模) produces one (一) appearance (样). It derives from the ancient art of bronze casting, where master craftsmen used precise molds to create identical pieces. The repetition of '一' (one) emphasizes perfect replication. Initially used to praise exceptional craftsmanship in creating matching sets of imperial artifacts, it later expanded beyond artisanal contexts. During the Qing Dynasty, it became associated with the imperial examination system's emphasis on standardization. Modern usage often carries a dual meaning - while it can praise precision and consistency, it sometimes critically refers to excessive conformity or lack of originality.

## Examples
