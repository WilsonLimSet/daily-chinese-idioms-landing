**Literal meaning:** With tiger plot skin

## Origin & Usage

Originating from the 'Strategies of the Warring States' around 300 BCE, the phrase describes the futility of discussing with a tiger (与虎) about acquiring its skin (谋皮). The metaphor emerged from diplomatic discourse about impossible negotiations where self-preservation inevitably overrides agreements. Tang Dynasty strategists frequently invoked it in political discussions, with tigers representing both power and fundamental self-interest. Modern usage spans business negotiations to international relations, describing situations where one party is asked to surrender something essential to their survival.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Negotiating with the monopoly about fair pricing was like asking a tiger for its own hide
