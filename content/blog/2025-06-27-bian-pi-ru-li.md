**Pronunciation:** *biān pì rù lǐ*  
**Literal meaning:** Whip strikes into core

## Origin & Usage

This penetrating idiom describes how a whip strike (鞭辟) penetrates (入) to the innermost layer (里), originating from Tang Dynasty literary criticism. It first appeared in evaluations of essays that revealed profound truths beneath surface appearances. The whip metaphor reflected the sharp, cutting power of incisive analysis. During the Song Dynasty, the expression became associated with Neo-Confucian philosophical methods that sought to penetrate superficial understanding to reach deeper principles. Unlike terms for general comprehension, it specifically honors analysis that reveals hidden depths. Modern usage describes intellectual work that cuts through complexity to expose fundamental truths, particularly in academic, literary, or philosophical contexts.

## Examples

**English:** "The critic's analysis penetrated to the very heart of the artwork's meaning"

**Chinese:** 评论家的分析深入到艺术作品含义的核心
