**Pronunciation:** *jǔ yī fǎn sān*  
**Literal meaning:** Raise one reflect three

## Origin & Usage

This idiom stems from Confucius's teaching methodology, where he described the ideal student as one who could infer (反) three (三) things when taught one (举一). The concept appears in the Analects, where Confucius praised students who could extrapolate broader principles from specific examples. During the Han Dynasty, this approach became fundamental to scholarly education, emphasizing active learning over mere memorization. The metaphor suggests that knowledge, like light, can illuminate multiple areas from a single source. In modern education and business contexts, it describes the ability to grasp underlying principles and apply them creatively to new situations, particularly valued in fields requiring innovative problem-solving.

## Examples

**English:** "After understanding this principle, she could solve similar problems easily"

**Chinese:** 理解了这个原理后，她能轻松解决类似的问题
