**Pronunciation:** *háo wú yí wèn*
**Literal meaning:** Not slightest doubt

## Origin & Usage

Ming Dynasty legal terminology gave us this expression of absolute certainty, where not (无) the slightest (毫) question (疑问) remains. Legal documents used it to describe evidence so conclusive it left no room for doubt. The microscopic measurement '毫' - referring to the finest hair or smallest weight - created the perfect image of searching for even the tiniest uncertainty and finding none. Today it describes propositions supported by evidence so overwhelming that no reasonable doubt remains.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The evidence clearly established the defendant's innocence beyond any doubt
