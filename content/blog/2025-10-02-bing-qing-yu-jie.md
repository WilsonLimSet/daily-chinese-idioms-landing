## {{originUsage}}

This purity idiom pairs the clarity of ice (冰清) with the unsullied nature of jade (玉洁), originating from Han Dynasty descriptions of exemplary officials. It first gained prominence through the 'Book of Later Han,' where these natural elements served as metaphors for incorruptible character. During the Tang Dynasty, it became particularly associated with the moral expectations of scholar-officials. Both elements carried deep cultural significance - ice representing transparent clarity, jade symbolizing enduring value that improves with polishing. Modern usage describes professional ethics or personal reputation untainted by compromise, particularly in public service where absolute integrity is essential.
