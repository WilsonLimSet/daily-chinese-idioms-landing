**Pronunciation:** *rú zuì rú mèng*  
**Literal meaning:** Like drunk like dream

## Origin & Usage

This ethereal idiom compares an experience to being both drunk (醉) and dreaming (梦), originating from Tang Dynasty poetry. It first appeared in Li Bai's verses describing transcendent states where boundaries between reality and illusion dissolve. The repeated structure of 'like' (如) emphasizes the dual nature of the experience - neither fully intoxicated nor dreaming, but similar to both states simultaneously. During the Song Dynasty, it expanded beyond poetic contexts to describe any profoundly disorienting yet beautiful experience. Unlike terms for simple confusion, it carries positive connotations of pleasant disorientation. Modern usage describes aesthetically overwhelming experiences where reality seems temporarily suspended, particularly in contexts of natural beauty, artistic immersion, or profound emotional states.
