**Pronunciation:** *xìn shǒu niān lái*  
**Literal meaning:** Trustingly hand plucks

## Origin & Usage

This fluent idiom describes casually (信手) picking up or plucking (拈来) something with ease, originating from Tang Dynasty descriptions of master calligraphers and poets. It first described how accomplished artists could produce works spontaneously without preparation or strain. The character 信 conveyed natural confidence while 拈 specifically depicted the delicate motion of fingers picking something small. During the Song Dynasty, it became associated with scholarly excellence, where classical references and compositions came effortlessly to well-trained minds. Modern usage describes expertise so internalized that sophisticated performance appears casual, particularly in creative or intellectual contexts where complex skills have become second nature through long practice.

## Examples

**English:** "The master poet composed beautiful verses effortlessly during the gathering"
