**Pronunciation:** *mò míng qí miào*  
**Literal meaning:** Cannot name its wonder

## Origin & Usage

Originating in Daoist texts describing inexplicable mysteries, this phrase captures the sensation of encountering something whose wonder (妙) cannot (莫) be named (名). During the Six Dynasties period, it was frequently used in poetry and philosophical writings to describe transcendent experiences. Buddhist translators later adopted it to express concepts of ineffable enlightenment. In contemporary usage, it's evolved to describe confusing or inexplicable situations, though it retains a subtle appreciation for life's mysteries that distinguishes it from purely negative expressions of confusion.

## Examples

**English:** "The teacher's patient guidance slowly transformed the struggling student"
