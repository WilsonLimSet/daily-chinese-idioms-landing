**Pronunciation:** *qián lǘ jì qióng*  
**Literal meaning:** Donkey's tricks exhausted

## Origin & Usage

This wry expression originates from a Tang Dynasty essay about a donkey (驴) in Guizhou (黔) province whose initial novelty made it seem special, until its limited tricks (技) were exhausted (穷). The story mocks superficial talents that quickly reveal their limitations. When first brought to the region, the donkey amazed locals who had never seen such a creature, but its appeal faded once its ordinary nature became apparent. Contemporary usage describes someone whose supposedly impressive abilities prove shallow or situations where initial promise gives way to revealed mediocrity. It serves as a caution against overvaluing novelty without substance.

## Examples
