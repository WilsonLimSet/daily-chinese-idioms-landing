**Pronunciation:** *yī yán jiǔ dǐng*  
**Literal meaning:** Words heavy as nine cauldrons

## Origin & Usage

During the Zhou Dynasty, nine sacred bronze cauldrons (鼎) symbolized imperial authority. This idiom equates a single (一) word (言) with the weight of these nine (九) vessels, emphasizing extraordinary trustworthiness. The historical bronze dings required immense strength to move, making them perfect metaphors for weighty promises. The phrase gained prominence through stories of ancient rulers and ministers whose mere words carried more authority than written treaties. In contemporary use, it describes someone whose promises are absolutely reliable or statements that carry exceptional gravity. Often invoked in business agreements or personal vows where trust supersedes formal documentation.

## Examples

**English:** "The CEO's brief statement immediately restored investor confidence"

**Chinese:** CEO简短的声明立即恢复了投资者的信心
