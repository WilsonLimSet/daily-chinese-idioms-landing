## Origin & Usage

First appearing in the Book of Changes, this idiom describes the ability to see (见) subtle signs (微) to understand (知) significant developments (著). During the Warring States period, strategist Sun Bin emphasized this principle in military observation. The concept gained broader application during the Song Dynasty, when scholars applied it to historical analysis and governance. Modern usage emphasizes the importance of recognizing patterns and trends from early indicators, particularly in business strategy and scientific research.
