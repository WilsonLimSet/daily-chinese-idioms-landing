**Pronunciation:** *gōng bù yìng qiú*
**Literal meaning:** Supply cannot meet demand

## Origin & Usage

Han Dynasty economic reports first used this phrase to describe how provision (供) cannot (不) meet (应) demand (求) during grain shortages. Tang Dynasty market theorists expanded it into a broader principle of economic dynamics. The phrase captures that fundamental tension between limited production and unlimited wants that drives market behavior. Today it describes any situation where demand overwhelms available supply.

## When to Use
