**Pronunciation:** *míng chá qiū háo*  
**Literal meaning:** See autumn down clear

## Origin & Usage

Drawing from ancient Chinese optics and medicine, this phrase describes the ability to clearly (明) observe (察) autumn (秋) down - the finest hair on an animal's body (毫). During the Han Dynasty, it became associated with legendary judge Bao Zheng, known for perceiving subtle details others missed. The autumn reference is significant - traditional Chinese medicine believed vision was clearest in fall. In contemporary use, it describes both literal visual acuity and metaphorical perceptiveness in analyzing complex situations.

## Examples

**English:** "The detective noticed subtle inconsistencies others missed"

**Chinese:** 侦探注意到了别人忽略的细微矛盾
