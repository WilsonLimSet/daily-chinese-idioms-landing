**Pronunciation:** *yuán yuǎn liú cháng*  
**Literal meaning:** Source distant, flow long

## Origin & Usage

This idiom uses the metaphor of a river with distant (远) sources (源) and long (长) flow (流) to describe things with deep historical roots and lasting influence. The phrase appeared in Confucian commentaries praising traditions that connect past to present through unbroken transmission. It emphasizes both antiquity and continuity - not just old, but enduringly vital. Modern usage commonly describes cultural traditions, academic disciplines, family lineages, or any institution with deep historical foundations that remain relevant.
