**Pronunciation:** *lǎo mǎ shí tú*  
**Literal meaning:** Old horse knows way

## Origin & Usage

Dating back to the Zhou Dynasty, this idiom comes from the story of Duke Mu of Qin who, lost in unfamiliar territory, relied on an old horse (老马) to find their way (识途) home through a snowstorm. The horse, having traversed these paths in its youth, remembered the safe routes despite years passing. Originally documented in 'Hanfeizi', it reflected ancient Chinese military wisdom about valuing experienced guides. In modern usage, it celebrates the irreplaceable value of experience, particularly in navigating complex situations. The metaphor resonates in professional mentorship, where seasoned veterans guide younger colleagues through challenging terrain, highlighting how certain knowledge can only be acquired through years of practical experience.

## Examples

**English:** "The veteran guide easily found the path in difficult terrain"

**Chinese:** 经验丰富的向导在困难地形中轻松找到道路
