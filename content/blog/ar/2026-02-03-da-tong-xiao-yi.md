**Literal meaning:** Largely same, slightly different

## Origin & Usage

This idiom has roots in the Confucian concept of 'datong' (大同), meaning 'great unity' or 'grand harmony,' which described an ideal society. The phrase acknowledges that while things may appear different on the surface, they share fundamental similarities. The contrast between 'large' (大) sameness (同) and 'small' (小) differences (异) suggests that what unites is more significant than what divides. Modern usage describes things that are essentially alike despite superficial variations, often used when comparing products, ideas, or approaches.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Most smartphones today are largely similar with only minor differences.
