**Pronunciation:** *àn jiàn shāng rén*
**Literal meaning:** Hidden arrow wounds person

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from Tang Dynasty descriptions of battlefield ambush tactics before entering broader usage through Song Dynasty records of court intrigue, where officials used indirect methods to damage rivals' reputations. The imagery of hidden arrows (暗箭) wounding people (伤人) was particularly effective—arrows strike from distance with deadly accuracy while concealing the attacker. Unlike terms simply meaning 'harmful,' it specifically addresses the combination of deliberate concealment and damaging intent rather than just resulting injury. Modern usage spans workplace politics to social media, describing deliberately harmful actions designed to avoid accountability, particularly when the attacker seeks plausible deniability while still ensuring the victim and others recognize the source, creating intimidation without evidence sufficient for direct confrontation.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The employee spread anonymous criticisms about colleagues instead of addressing issues directly
