**Pronunciation:** *yī yè zhàng mù*  
**Literal meaning:** Leaf blocks eye

## Origin & Usage

This idiom illustrates how a single (一) leaf (叶) can block (障) one's vision/eyes (目). Emerging from Buddhist texts warning against limited perspective, it gained prominence during the Song Dynasty's Neo-Confucian movement. The deceptively simple image of a leaf blocking an entire view became a powerful metaphor for how minor distractions can prevent broader understanding. In contemporary contexts, it critiques tunnel vision in decision-making, from business strategy to political analysis, reminding us that fixation on small details can obscure the larger picture.

## Examples

**English:** "The team got lost in technical details and forgot the project's main goal"

**Chinese:** 团队陷入技术细节而忘记了项目的主要目标
