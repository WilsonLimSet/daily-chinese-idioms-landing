**Pronunciation:** *qīng chū yú lán*  
**Literal meaning:** Blue comes from indigo plant

## Origin & Usage

This idiom comes from a statement by Xunzi, noting that while blue (青) dye comes from (出于) the indigo plant (蓝), it surpasses its source in depth of color. The metaphor gained prominence during the Han Dynasty in discussions of education and generational progress. It celebrates how students can surpass their teachers, children their parents, or disciples their masters - not as a challenge to authority but as the natural outcome of good mentorship. During the Tang Dynasty, it became particularly associated with artistic lineages where students developed their own styles while honoring their teachers' foundations. Modern usage encourages both ambitious development and grateful acknowledgment of one's foundations.

## Examples
