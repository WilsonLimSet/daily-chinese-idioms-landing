## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes being able to see everything in one (一) glance (览) with nothing (无) remaining hidden (余). The phrase appeared in classical landscape descriptions praising expansive vistas. It captures the clarity and completeness of unobstructed vision. Beyond physical scenery, it can describe situations where everything is transparent and easily understood. Modern usage describes panoramic views, comprehensive understanding, or situations where nothing is hidden from observation.
