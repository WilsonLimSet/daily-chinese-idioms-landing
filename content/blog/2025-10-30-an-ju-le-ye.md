## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from Han Dynasty governmental ideals in the 'Book of Han,' first appearing as an administrative goal representing balanced prosperity. During the Tang Dynasty, it became standard terminology in policy documents measuring governance success. The pairing of peaceful dwelling (安居) and enjoyable work (乐业) was particularly meaningful—covering both private domestic life and public economic activity as complementary spheres. Unlike terms simply meaning 'prosperity,' it specifically balances material residence with productive occupation rather than focusing solely on wealth. Modern usage spans government policy to personal aspirations, describing the fundamental social stability allowing ordinary citizens to live without fear while engaged in meaningful work, representing the foundation upon which more elaborate social and cultural achievements can be built.

## When to Use

**Situation:** After years of turmoil, the region finally achieved stability where families could live securely and pursue livelihoods
