**Pronunciation:** *wàng qí xiàng bèi*  
**Literal meaning:** See only their neck back

## Origin & Usage

This vivid phrase describes only being able to see someone's neck (项) and back (背) while looking up (望) at them, originally appearing in Confucian texts about students striving to match accomplished masters. The physical imagery of looking up at someone so far ahead that you can only see their back emerged from scholarly traditions where disciples would literally follow behind their teachers. Today, it's used to describe the experience of admiring someone's achievements while acknowledging the significant gap in skills or accomplishments, particularly relevant in professional mentorship and personal development contexts.

## Examples

**English:** "The startup was finally approaching the industry leaders' level"

**Chinese:** 这家创业公司终于接近了行业领导者的水平
