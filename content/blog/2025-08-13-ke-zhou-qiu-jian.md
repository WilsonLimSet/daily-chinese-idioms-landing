**Pronunciation:** *kè zhōu qiú jiàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Mark boat to find sword

## Origin & Usage

This misguided idiom describes marking (刻) a boat (舟) to locate (求) a sword (剑) that has fallen into water, originating from the Spring and Autumn period text 'Lüshi Chunqiu.' It tells of a man who dropped his sword from a boat into a river. Instead of accounting for the river's flow, he marked the boat's edge where the sword fell, expecting to find it at that marked spot later. The tale gained prominence during the Han Dynasty as a teaching example in logic and reasoning. Unlike terms for simple foolishness, it specifically criticizes rigid application of fixed reference points in changing circumstances. Modern usage describes obsolete methods applied to evolved situations, particularly relevant in rapidly changing fields where outdated approaches prove ineffective.

## Examples

**English:** "The company kept using outdated market research to make current business decisions"

**Chinese:** 公司继续使用过时的市场研究来做出当前的商业决策
