**Pronunciation:** *xū zhāng shēng shì*  
**Literal meaning:** Empty show of strength

## Origin & Usage

This deceptive idiom describes creating false (虚) displays (张) of power (势) through noise (声), originating from Warring States period military strategy. It described tactics where weaker forces would use drums, flags, and troops movements to appear more numerous than reality. The specific pairing of sound and visual elements referenced actual battlefield deception techniques. During the Han Dynasty, it expanded beyond military contexts to describe political and social bluffing. Unlike terms for simple deception, it specifically addresses creating illusions of power through exaggerated displays. Modern usage describes any attempt to appear more powerful, capable, or significant than reality through exaggerated claims or displays, particularly when attempting to influence others through perception management rather than actual capability.

## Examples

**English:** "The small company made grandiose claims about capabilities it couldn't possibly deliver"

**Chinese:** 这家小公司对它不可能实现的能力做出了宏大的声明
