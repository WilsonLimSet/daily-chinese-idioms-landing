**Pronunciation:** *xuán yá lè mǎ*  
**Literal meaning:** Pull horse at cliff edge

## Origin & Usage

This vivid idiom describes pulling (勒) a horse's reins at the edge of a cliff (悬崖), drawing from actual incidents along the treacherous mountain paths of ancient China. Military chronicles from the Warring States period detail how skilled horsemen would train their steeds to stop abruptly at dangerous precipices. The phrase gained wider use during the Ming Dynasty as a metaphor for last-minute course correction. In contemporary usage, it describes the crucial moment of recognizing and averting danger, whether in business decisions, personal relationships, or moral choices. It emphasizes both the importance of vigilance and the possibility of redemption even at the final moment.
