**Pronunciation:** *yì qǔ tóng gōng*  
**Literal meaning:** Different tune same effect

## Origin & Usage

This musical metaphor describes different (异) melodies (曲) achieving the same (同) artistic effect (工), first appearing in Tang Dynasty music criticism. It originated from evaluations of how regional folk tunes could evoke similar emotional responses despite using different musical structures. The concept gained broader application during the Song Dynasty, when scholars recognized how different philosophical approaches could reach similar ethical conclusions. The specific reference to 'gong' (工) - craftsmanship or effect - emphasized results over methods. Modern usage celebrates the validity of diverse approaches to shared goals, particularly valuable in multicultural contexts or interdisciplinary projects where different methodologies can produce equally valid outcomes.

## Examples

**English:** "The two companies used different methods but achieved equally excellent results"

**Chinese:** 这两家公司采用不同的方法，但取得了同样出色的结果
