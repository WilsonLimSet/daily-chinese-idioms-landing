**Pronunciation:** *zhěn shí shù liú*  
**Literal meaning:** Pillow stone rinse stream

## Origin & Usage

Drawing from the biography of the recluse-scholar Xu You, who chose to pillow (枕) on stones (石) and rinse (漱) his mouth with flowing (流) stream water rather than accept a position at court during the Yao period. This Wei-Jin period idiom embodied the classical Chinese ideal of maintaining personal integrity through voluntary simplicity. The image of using rocks as pillows and stream water for basic needs represented a profound rejection of material comfort in pursuit of spiritual freedom. The story resonated deeply during periods of political turmoil, inspiring countless scholars to choose principled reclusion over compromised service. Modern usage celebrates those who choose principle over profit, authenticity over advancement, particularly in contexts where maintaining ethical standards requires personal sacrifice.
