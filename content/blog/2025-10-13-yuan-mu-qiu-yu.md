**Pronunciation:** *yuán mù qiú yú*
**Literal meaning:** Climb tree seek fish

## Origin & Usage

Mencius first used this vivid image of climbing trees (缘木) to catch fish (求鱼) in the 4th century BCE, criticizing approaches that ignore natural principles. The absurdity of seeking aquatic life in arboreal settings perfectly captured the futility of mismatched methods and goals. Han Dynasty political discourse adopted it as shorthand for fundamentally misguided approaches. Today, it serves as a powerful reminder in business strategy and education that effort, however intense, cannot overcome a fundamentally flawed approach.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The company sought manufacturing efficiency by hiring more managers instead of upgrading equipment
