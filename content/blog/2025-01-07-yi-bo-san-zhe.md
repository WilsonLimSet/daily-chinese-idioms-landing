**Pronunciation:** *yī bō sān zhé*  
**Literal meaning:** One wave three turns

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from the Jin Dynasty master calligrapher Wang Xizhi's observation about brushwork, where he noted that when drawing one (一) wave (波), he would fold or turn (折) his brush three (三) times. This technical description of calligraphic technique evolved beyond its artistic origins to become a metaphor for life's twists and turns. The imagery is particularly apt as each brush stroke in wave-like characters requires multiple precise movements, just as life rarely follows a straight path. During the Tang and Song dynasties, the phrase gained broader usage in literature to describe complicated situations or journeys with multiple setbacks. In modern usage, it describes experiences that involve unexpected difficulties or multiple complications, much like a wave that changes direction three times before reaching shore.
