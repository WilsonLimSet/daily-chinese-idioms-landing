**Pronunciation:** *tiě zhèng rú shān*  
**Literal meaning:** Iron evidence like a mountain

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes evidence that is as solid as iron (铁) and as immovable as a mountain (如山). The combination of these two images emphasizes both the quality and quantity of proof - iron suggests irrefutability while mountain suggests overwhelming volume. The phrase emerged in legal and forensic contexts during the Ming Dynasty. It represents the ideal standard of proof that leaves no room for doubt. Modern usage commonly appears in legal, journalistic, and debate contexts to describe conclusive evidence.

## Examples

**English:** "The prosecution presented overwhelming evidence against the defendant."

**Chinese:** 控方提出了铁证如山的证据。
