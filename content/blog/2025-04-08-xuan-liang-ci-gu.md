**Pronunciation:** *xuán liáng cì gǔ*  
**Literal meaning:** Hang beam stab thigh

## Origin & Usage

This idiom pairs two classical studying techniques: tying (悬) hair to a beam (梁) to prevent dozing off and stabbing (刺) one's thigh (股) with an awl to stay alert. These practices were attributed to Su Qin and Sun Jing, two scholars from the Warring States period who initially failed their examinations but eventually achieved great success through determined studying. The stories appeared in numerous educational texts throughout the Han Dynasty, becoming powerful symbols of academic persistence. While the literal practices aren't endorsed today, the idiom remains a potent symbol of academic dedication, frequently invoked during intense preparation periods before major examinations. Modern usage extends to any situation requiring extraordinary dedication to learning or skill development, particularly in competitive professional environments.
