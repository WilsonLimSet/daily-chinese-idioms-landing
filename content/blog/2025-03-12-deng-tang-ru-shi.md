**Literal meaning:** Enter hall reach inner room

## Origin & Usage

Originally describing the physical progression from entering (登) the main hall (堂) to reaching (入) the inner chambers (室) of traditional Chinese homes, this idiom emerged from early Confucian texts. The architectural metaphor illustrated the structured nature of classical education, where students moved through clearly defined levels of learning. The imagery resonated deeply in Chinese pedagogical tradition, where knowledge was seen as a series of increasingly intimate spaces to be accessed through disciplined study. Modern usage describes any systematic progression from foundational knowledge to expertise, particularly in traditional arts and academic disciplines.
