**Pronunciation:** *bú zé shǒu duàn*
**Literal meaning:** Not choose methods

## Origin & Usage

Tang Dynasty historians first used this phrase to criticize those who refuse to discriminate (不择) between different means (手段) in pursuing their goals. Song Dynasty Confucian scholars developed it into a broader ethical principle about ends never justifying means. The selective metaphor powerfully suggests that choosing between available methods represents a moral duty, making its abandonment particularly reprehensible.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The politician secured votes through intimidation, bribery, and misinformation campaigns
