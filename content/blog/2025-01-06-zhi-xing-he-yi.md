**Pronunciation:** *zhī xíng hé yī*  
**Literal meaning:** Knowledge and action unite as one

## Origin & Usage

Popularized by Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming in the Ming Dynasty, this idiom unites knowledge (知) and action (行) as one (合一). Wang challenged the traditional separation between theoretical understanding and practical application, arguing that true knowledge inherently manifests in action. His revolutionary philosophy emerged from personal experience during political exile, where he observed that mere book learning without practical application was meaningless. The concept profoundly influenced East Asian philosophical thought and later resonated with Western pragmatist philosophy. In modern usage, it particularly applies to professional fields where theory and practice must align - from medical training to business management. It advocates for learning through doing and reminds us that understanding is incomplete without application.

## Examples
