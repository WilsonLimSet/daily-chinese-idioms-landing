**Pronunciation:** *cū xīn dà yì*
**Literal meaning:** Rough heart and careless mind

## Origin & Usage

This idiom combines 'rough/coarse' (粗) heart (心) with 'big/careless' (大) intention (意) to describe a lack of attention to detail. While both components independently suggest carelessness, together they emphasize habitual inattention rather than momentary lapses. The phrase gained currency in Ming Dynasty moral instruction texts warning against neglecting details. It remains commonly used in educational and professional settings to describe someone who makes avoidable mistakes due to insufficient care and attention.

## When to Use

**Situation:** His carelessness caused the crucial error in the report.
