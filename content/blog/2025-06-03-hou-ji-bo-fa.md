**Pronunciation:** *hòu jī bó fā*  
**Literal meaning:** Thick accumulation thin launch

## Origin & Usage

This idiom compares patient accumulation (积) of deep (厚) knowledge with the eventual release (发) that requires minimal (薄) effort. It emerged during the Tang Dynasty literary circles, where scholars emphasized sustained preparation over hasty creation. Historical accounts describe how poet Du Fu spent decades studying before his relatively brief period of prolific composition. The image resonated particularly with Song Dynasty Neo-Confucians who valued gradual self-cultivation. In modern contexts, it applies to any domain where extended preparation enables seemingly effortless execution - from scientific research to artistic mastery to business innovation. It cautions against premature action while promising that thorough preparation often makes eventual success appear deceptively simple.

## Examples

**English:** "After years of quiet research, her breakthrough theory revolutionized the field"

**Chinese:** 经过多年的默默研究，她的突破性理论彻底革新了这个领域
