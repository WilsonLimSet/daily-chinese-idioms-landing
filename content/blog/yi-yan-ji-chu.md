**Pronunciation:** *yī yán jì chū*  
**Literal meaning:** Once a word is spoken

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes once (既) a word (一言) is spoken (出). It is often paired with 驷马难追 (four horses cannot catch it) to emphasize that spoken words cannot be taken back. The phrase stresses the weight of verbal commitments. Modern usage emphasizes the importance of being careful with promises, as words once spoken create obligations that must be honored.

## Examples

**English:** "He kept his promise because he believed a man's word is his bond."

**Chinese:** 他信守承诺，因为他相信一言既出，驷马难追。
