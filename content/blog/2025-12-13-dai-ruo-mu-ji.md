**Pronunciation:** *dāi ruò mù jī*
**Literal meaning:** Dumbfounded like wooden chicken

## Origin & Usage

Zhuangzi's Daoist texts introduced this vivid image of being stunned (呆) like a wooden chicken (木鸡), originally describing meditation-induced stillness. Han Dynasty writers transformed it into a description of shock-induced paralysis. The comparison to a wooden chicken proved particularly apt - these normally active birds becoming unnaturally still perfectly captured the essence of stunned immobility.
