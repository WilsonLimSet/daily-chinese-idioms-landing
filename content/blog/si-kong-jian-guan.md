**Pronunciation:** *sī kōng jiàn guàn*  
**Literal meaning:** Minister of Works sees it habitually

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originates from a Tang Dynasty story where the poet Liu Yuxi visited Minister of Works (司空) Li Shen. When beautiful courtesans performed, Liu composed a poem noting that such sights were habitual (见惯) to the minister. The phrase evolved to describe anything so common it no longer attracts attention. Modern usage describes phenomena that have become routine through frequency, losing their ability to surprise or impress.

## Examples

**English:** "Traffic jams have become so common that no one complains anymore."

**Chinese:** 交通堵塞已经司空见惯，没人再抱怨了。
