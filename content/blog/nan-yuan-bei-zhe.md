**Pronunciation:** *nán yuán běi zhé*
**Literal meaning:** Driving south while heading north

## Origin & Usage

This idiom comes from 'Strategies of the Warring States' (战国策). A man wanted to travel to the southern state of Chu but drove his carriage north. When asked why, he boasted of his fast horses, skilled driver, and ample provisions, failing to realize that these advantages would only take him further from his destination. The story illustrates how having resources means nothing if one's direction is fundamentally wrong. Modern usage describes actions that are counterproductive to stated intentions or methods that contradict desired outcomes.

## When to Use

**Situation:** His business strategy was completely counterproductive to his stated goals.
