**Pronunciation:** *bǎi chǐ gān tóu*  
**Literal meaning:** Hundred foot pole top

## Origin & Usage

Emerging from Chan Buddhist teachings of the Tang Dynasty, this idiom depicts a person balanced atop a hundred-foot (百尺) pole (竿头). The image comes from a dialogue between Master Fengxue and his disciples about transcendence, suggesting that true achievement requires advancing even when you seem to have reached the summit. The metaphor resonated deeply with scholar-officials preparing for imperial examinations, who understood that reaching high rank was only the beginning of their challenge. Modern usage emphasizes pushing beyond apparent limits, particularly in academic and professional contexts where complacency can halt growth.

## Examples
