**Pronunciation:** *shēn bù yóu jǐ*  
**Literal meaning:** Body not self-controlled

## Origin & Usage

This constrained idiom describes situations where one's body/self (身) is not (不) governed (由) by oneself (己), originating from Han Dynasty discussions of social obligation. It first appeared in texts examining how individuals must sometimes act against personal inclination due to duty, position, or circumstances. During the Tang Dynasty, historians used it to explain officials' actions under imperial pressure. The specific reference to the physical body (身) emphasized how external forces could control even one's physical movements. Modern usage describes situations where external pressures or obligations force actions contrary to personal preference, particularly professional contexts where organizational demands override individual judgment.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The executive had to implement policies she personally disagreed with
