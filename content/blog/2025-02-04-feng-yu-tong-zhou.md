**Pronunciation:** *fēng yǔ tóng zhōu*  
**Literal meaning:** Share boat in wind and rain

## Origin & Usage

Closely related to '同舟共济' but with added emotional depth, this idiom evokes sharing a boat (同舟) amid wind (风) and rain (雨). It first appeared in Song Dynasty poetry describing political allies weathering court intrigues together. The imagery draws from the experiences of river travelers who formed deep bonds facing storms in small boats, where survival demanded absolute trust and cooperation. Modern usage emphasizes enduring friendships and partnerships tested by adversity, particularly in business relationships and personal bonds. The idiom suggests that challenging circumstances reveal the true strength of relationships, celebrating connections that become stronger rather than break under pressure.

## Examples

**English:** "The partners stood by each other through business difficulties"

**Chinese:** 合伙人在企业困难时期互相支持
