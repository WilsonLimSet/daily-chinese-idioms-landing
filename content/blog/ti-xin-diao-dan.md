**Literal meaning:** Lift heart hang gall

## Origin & Usage

This idiom originated from Song Dynasty medical descriptions of physiological responses to terror. It first appeared in clinical texts explaining how fear affects internal organs before becoming metaphorical. During the Ming Dynasty, vernacular literature adopted it to describe characters experiencing prolonged dread. The sensation of one's heart lifted up (提心) and gallbladder suspended (吊胆) created visceral imagery that was particularly powerful—traditional Chinese medicine considered these organs central to emotional stability, making their displacement emblematic of extreme distress. Unlike terms simply meaning 'worried,' it specifically describes consuming anxiety creating physical symptoms rather than mere concern. Modern usage spans psychological conditions to temporary situations, describing anxiety so intense it creates physical sensations, particularly when legitimate dangers create extended hypervigilance that itself becomes physically and mentally debilitating.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The parents waited anxiously for their teenager to return home after midnight
