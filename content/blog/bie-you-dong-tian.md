**Pronunciation:** *bié yǒu dòng tiān*
**Literal meaning:** Having another cave heaven

## Origin & Usage

This idiom derives from Daoist mythology, where 'cave heavens' (洞天) were believed to be paradisiacal realms hidden within mountains, accessible only to immortals or the spiritually enlightened. These hidden worlds represented a different (别) reality existing alongside the mundane world. The phrase first appeared in Tang Dynasty poetry describing scenic discoveries. Modern usage describes finding unexpected beauty, depth, or interest in something that appears ordinary from the outside, celebrating hidden wonders and pleasant surprises.

## When to Use

**Situation:** Behind the modest entrance lies a surprisingly beautiful garden.
