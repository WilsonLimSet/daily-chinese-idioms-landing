**Pronunciation:** *yī míng jīng rén*  
**Literal meaning:** Bird cry that startles all

## Origin & Usage

This idiom emerged during the Han Dynasty in scholarly discourse about late-blooming talent. The image of a seemingly ordinary bird (鸣, cry) suddenly producing an extraordinary song that startles (惊) everyone (人) was inspired by the story of a rural scholar who, after years of obscurity, stunned the imperial court with his brilliance. The metaphor draws from ancient Chinese ornithology, where certain birds were known to remain silent for long periods before producing remarkably beautiful songs. In imperial examination culture, it became associated with candidates who achieved unexpected success. Modern usage extends to any dramatic debut or breakthrough - from artists releasing career-defining works to researchers making groundbreaking discoveries. It captures the universal experience of hidden potential suddenly revealed.
