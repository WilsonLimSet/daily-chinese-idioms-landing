**Pronunciation:** *wú suǒ shì shì*  
**Literal meaning:** Nothing to do as occupation

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes having nothing (无所) to do as one's occupation (事事). It depicts a state of idleness where one has no meaningful activities or responsibilities. The phrase can describe temporary boredom, chronic aimlessness, or forced inactivity. It appeared in classical texts often critically, as Chinese culture valued industriousness. Modern usage describes periods of having nothing productive to do, whether temporary situations or more concerning patterns of purposelessness.

## Examples

**English:** "After retirement, he felt aimless with nothing to occupy his time."

**Chinese:** 退休后，他无所事事，感到很迷茫。
