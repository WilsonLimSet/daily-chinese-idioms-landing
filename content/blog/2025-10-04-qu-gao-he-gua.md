**Pronunciation:** *qǔ gāo hè guǎ*
**Literal meaning:** Tune high harmony few

## Origin & Usage

This cultural idiom observes that when a tune is too sophisticated (曲高), few can harmonize (和寡) with it. It originates from the 'Book of Han' biography of music master Li Yannian, whose complex compositions impressed Emperor Wu but remained inaccessible to ordinary listeners. During the Tang Dynasty's poetic golden age, it became central to debates about artistic accessibility versus sophistication. The musical metaphor perfectly captured the challenge faced by advanced works - technical excellence often limiting popular appeal. Modern usage spans artistic contexts to specialized fields, describing exceptional work that earns expert admiration while remaining inaccessible to general audiences.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The experimental film received critical acclaim but struggled to find a mainstream audience
