**Pronunciation:** *hè fà tóng yán*  
**Literal meaning:** Crane hair, child face

## Origin & Usage

This complimentary idiom describes someone with white hair (鹤发) like a crane yet maintaining a child-like complexion (童颜), representing the ideal of aging gracefully. It first appeared in Tang Dynasty texts describing Daoist masters who supposedly preserved youthful vitality through meditation and alchemical practices. During the Song Dynasty, the phrase became associated with scholars who maintained intellectual vigor into old age. The crane imagery was particularly significant as these birds represented both longevity and wisdom in Chinese symbolism. Modern usage celebrates elderly individuals who maintain physical health, mental acuity, and spirited attitudes despite advanced age, embodying the traditional Chinese ideal that wisdom and vitality need not diminish together.
