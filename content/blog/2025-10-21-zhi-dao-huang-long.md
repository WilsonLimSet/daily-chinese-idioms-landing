**Pronunciation:** *zhí dǎo huáng lóng*
**Literal meaning:** Directly attack Yellow Dragon

## Origin & Usage

General Yue Fei's determination to recapture northern territories gave birth to this bold strategy of striking directly (直捣) at the Yellow Dragon (黄龙) - the Jin Dynasty's imperial palace in Kaifeng. The geographic symbolism carried both literal and metaphoric weight, representing both the physical seat of power and the heart of enemy strength. Song Dynasty military commanders adopted it as the ultimate expression of decisive action. Modern strategists, from military planners to business leaders, still invoke it to advocate bypassing peripheral targets to strike at the decisive center of power.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The military campaign bypassed smaller targets to strike directly at the enemy's capital
