**Pronunciation:** *yǎn gāo shǒu dī*  
**Literal meaning:** Eyes high hands low

## Origin & Usage

This discrepant idiom contrasts high (高) eyes/standards (眼) with low (低) hands/abilities (手), originating from Ming Dynasty craft guilds. It described apprentices who could recognize quality work but lacked the skill to produce it themselves. The anatomical metaphor created a vivid image of the gap between perception and execution. During the Qing Dynasty, literary circles adopted it to criticize reviewers who couldn't match the achievements they evaluated. Unlike terms for simple hypocrisy, it acknowledges the genuine ability to recognize quality while highlighting the execution gap. Modern usage describes the common situation where analytical ability outpaces productive capability, particularly in creative fields where critical faculty often develops before technical mastery.

## Examples

**English:** "The critic could identify flaws in others' work but couldn't produce anything better himself"

**Chinese:** 这位评论家能指出他人作品中的缺陷，但自己却创作不出更好的作品
