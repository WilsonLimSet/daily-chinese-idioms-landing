**Pronunciation:** *zhǐ sāng mà huái*  
**Literal meaning:** Point mulberry, curse locust tree

## Origin & Usage

This indirect idiom describes pointing at (指) mulberry trees (桑) while cursing (骂) locust trees (槐), originating from the Spring and Autumn period. It first appeared in diplomatic accounts where criticizing minor states actually delivered messages to major powers without direct confrontation. The botanical pairing was meaningful as both trees were common in ancient Chinese landscapes but served different purposes. During the Han Dynasty, it became standard terminology for indirect criticism in court politics. Modern usage describes the rhetorical strategy of addressing criticism to one target while actually intending it for another, particularly in hierarchical contexts where direct criticism might prove too risky or inappropriate.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The manager criticized one employee while actually targeting another who understood the message
