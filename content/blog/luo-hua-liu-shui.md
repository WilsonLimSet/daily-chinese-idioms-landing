**Pronunciation:** *luò huā liú shuǐ*
**Literal meaning:** Falling flowers and flowing water

## Origin & Usage

This poetic idiom originally described the beautiful natural scene of fallen petals floating on flowing streams, appearing in Tang Dynasty poetry as an image of transient beauty. However, its meaning evolved to describe utter defeat or disarray, like flowers scattered helplessly by water currents. The transformation from aesthetic appreciation to military metaphor occurred during the Song Dynasty. Modern usage primarily describes crushing defeats or chaotic retreats, though it occasionally retains its original poetic sense in literary contexts.

## When to Use

**Situation:** The army was utterly defeated and scattered in all directions.
