**Pronunciation:** *wú zhōng shēng yǒu*  
**Literal meaning:** Create something from nothing

## Origin & Usage

This idiom has dual origins. Philosophically, it derives from the Daoist concept in 'Tao Te Ching' that all things emerge from nothingness (无) to existence (有). Strategically, it appears in the 'Thirty-Six Stratagems' as a deceptive military tactic of creating threats or advantages from nothing. The phrase can describe both creative innovation and deceptive fabrication, depending on context. Modern usage often carries negative connotations of making false accusations or spreading rumors, though it can also describe genuine creativity or innovation.

## Examples

**English:** "He fabricated the entire story out of thin air."

**Chinese:** 他无中生有，编造了整个故事。
