**Pronunciation:** *xīn zhào bù xuān*  
**Literal meaning:** Hearts illuminate without declaring

## Origin & Usage

This idiom describes hearts (心) that illuminate/understand each other (照) without (不) explicit declaration (宣). It captures the special rapport between people who understand each other so well that verbal communication becomes unnecessary. The phrase values intuitive understanding over explicit statement. It appears in texts describing close relationships, from friendships to business partnerships. Modern usage describes tacit agreements, unspoken understandings, or situations where people intuitively know what others think.

## Examples

**English:** "The partners shared an unspoken agreement about how to handle the situation."

**Chinese:** 合伙人心照不宣地达成了共识。
