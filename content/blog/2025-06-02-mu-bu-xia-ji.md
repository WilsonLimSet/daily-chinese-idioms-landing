**Pronunciation:** *mù bù xiá jǐ*  
**Literal meaning:** Eyes too busy to attend

## Origin & Usage

This vivid idiom emerged from Han Dynasty court records describing imperial inspections where officials' eyes (目) were too (不) occupied (暇) to properly attend to (给) everything before them. The phrase gained prominence during the Tang Dynasty's economic boom, when market inspectors used it to describe the challenge of monitoring bustling marketplaces. Historical documents show how the phrase spread from official contexts to describe any overwhelming visual experience. In modern usage, it often describes information overload in our digital age, from professionals managing multiple screens to tourists encountering sensory-rich environments. The idiom captures both the abundance of stimuli and the physical limitation of human attention.

## Examples

**English:** "The exhibition's countless displays overwhelmed visitors"
