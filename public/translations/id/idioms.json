    "description": "This idiom emerged during the Han Dynasty in scholarly discourse about late-blooming talent. The image of a seemingly ordinary bird (鸣, cry) suddenly producing an extraordinary song that startles (惊) everyone (人) was inspired by the story of a rural scholar who, after years of obscurity, stunned the imperial court with his brilliance. The metaphor draws from ancient Chinese ornithology, where certain birds were known to remain silent for long periods before producing remarkably beautiful songs. In imperial examination culture, it became associated with candidates who achieved unexpected success. Modern usage extends to any dramatic debut or breakthrough - from artists releasing career-defining works to researchers making groundbreaking discoveries. It captures the universal experience of hidden potential suddenly revealed.",

The metaphor originally referred to warming up old food to make it fresh again, suggesting that knowledge requires regular review to remain vital. During the Tang Dynasty, it became a fundamental principle of classical education, emphasizing that true learning combines respect for tradition with openness to new insights. The concept gained particular significance during the Song Dynasty renaissance, when scholars reinterpreted classical texts for contemporary challenges. Modern usage emphasizes the value of using historical knowledge to understand present situations, particularly relevant in fields like policy-making, business strategy, and cultural studies.",

During the Song Dynasty, it gained prominence in educational texts as encouragement for students who weren't naturally gifted. The imagery challenges the notion that innate talent determines success, instead emphasizing early preparation and persistent effort. In modern education and professional contexts, it advocates for proactive approaches to compensate for perceived disadvantages. The idiom particularly resonates in competitive environments where early preparation can level the playing field, teaching that consciousness of one's limitations can become a surprising advantage.",

The imagery draws from classical Chinese garden design, where winding paths deliberately obscured views to create moments of surprise and revelation. During the Song Dynasty, it evolved beyond its literal meaning to represent hope emerging from difficult circumstances. The contrast between darkness and light, obstruction and clarity, resonates particularly in Chinese philosophical thought about life's cyclical nature. Modern usage applies to any situation where unexpected solutions or opportunities emerge just when circumstances seem most challenging.",

    "description_tr": "This limiting idiom describes sitting (坐) in a well (井) while attempting to view (觀) the sky (天), originating from philosophical debates during the Warring States period. It first appeared in texts critiquing narrow viewpoints resulting from limited experience. The well imagery created a powerful metaphor for how restricted perspective distorts understanding - from the bottom of a well, the sky appears as merely a small circle. During the Han Dynasty, it became associated with cautionary tales about scholars who refused to consider viewpoints outside their tradition. Modern usage criticizes narrow-mindedness resulting from limited exposure or experience, emphasizing how environmental constraints shape perception and judgment, particularly in cross-cultural or interdisciplinary contexts.",

    "description": "This idiom comes from a longer expression where the city gate (城门) catches fire (失火), but the disaster spreads to harm fish in the moat (殃及池鱼). It originated from Han Dynasty governance warnings about how problems at centers of power affect even distant, unrelated parties. The image drew from actual urban disasters where city gates - critical defensive structures - could spread fire widely when burning. During the Tang Dynasty, historical chronicles used it to describe how imperial court scandals damaged provincial affairs. Modern usage describes collateral damage from major problems, particularly situations where powerful entities' difficulties harm innocent bystanders, like corporate scandals affecting rank-and-file employees or political conflicts harming civilian populations.",
