    "description": "This idiom emerged during the Han Dynasty in scholarly discourse about late-blooming talent. The image of a seemingly ordinary bird (鸣, cry) suddenly producing an extraordinary song that startles (惊) everyone (人) was inspired by the story of a rural scholar who, after years of obscurity, stunned the imperial court with his brilliance. The metaphor draws from ancient Chinese ornithology, where certain birds were known to remain silent for long periods before producing remarkably beautiful songs. In imperial examination culture, it became associated with candidates who achieved unexpected success. Modern usage extends to any dramatic debut or breakthrough - from artists releasing career-defining works to researchers making groundbreaking discoveries. It captures the universal experience of hidden potential suddenly revealed.",

By eliminating the possibility of retreat, he created absolute commitment to victory. During the Three Kingdoms period, this story became a classic example of decisive leadership and psychological warfare. The four characters create a powerful image of burning bridges to ensure total dedication. In modern contexts, it describes situations where success requires eliminating backup plans - from entrepreneurs investing all their resources to career changers making irreversible decisions. It teaches that certain achievements become possible only when retreat is no longer an option.",

    "description_tr": "A fascinating example of cross-cultural linguistic exchange, emerged during China's period of modernization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a direct translation of the English phrase 'killing two birds with one stone.' While sharing similar words - one (一) stone (石) two (二) birds (鳥) - it represents a broader pattern of Western concept adoption during this era of increasing global contact. The traditional Chinese equivalent, '一箭雙鵰' (one arrow, two eagles), better reflects indigenous hunting imagery.

First recorded in Warring States period texts, it illustrated how seemingly insignificant items could, through accumulation and patience, create something valuable. The detailed craft metaphor resonated with Chinese philosophical emphasis on gradual progress and careful accumulation. Modern applications range from financial advice about saving to project management principles about breaking large goals into smaller tasks. It teaches that no contribution is too small when part of a larger vision.",

A famous example comes from Lu Ban's treatise on carpentry, describing how master woodworkers would spend years perfecting a single joint technique.

    "description_tr": "This onomatopoeic idiom combines the sharp sound 'jia' (戛) with the character for 'thus' (然) and 'stop' (止), creating a vivid image of sudden cessation, originating from Han Dynasty music criticism. It first described performances where instruments stopped unexpectedly, breaking musical flow. The harsh consonant beginning matched the jarring experience of unexpected endings. During the Tang Dynasty, literary critics expanded its usage to describe narrative works with abrupt conclusions. The sound symbolism was particularly effective in Chinese aesthetics, where sonic qualities often reinforced meaning. Modern usage describes any unexpected termination - from interrupted conversations to discontinued projects - emphasizing both the suddenness and completeness of the cessation.",

    "description_tr": "This phrase originated from Song Dynasty etiquette manuals for merchant households, first providing guidance for commercial hospitality before broadening to general interpersonal warmth. During the Ming Dynasty, it entered assessments of social cultivation and character. The concept of treating others (待人) with enthusiasm and warmth (熱情) used a temperature metaphor that was particularly apt—warmth naturally draws people closer while coldness creates distance. Unlike terms simply meaning 'friendly,' it specifically emphasizes active, energetic goodwill rather than merely amiable disposition. Modern usage spans hospitality contexts to personal recommendations, describing the particular social skill of making others feel genuinely welcomed through demonstrated interest and energy, particularly valuing the ability to create immediate comfort and connection across status differences or with strangers.",

The concept appears in Confucius' discussions of different motivations for virtuous action, with internal happiness representing the highest form.
