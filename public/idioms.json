     "description": "This idiom emerged during the Han Dynasty in scholarly discourse about late-blooming talent. The image of a seemingly ordinary bird (鸣, cry) suddenly producing an extraordinary song that startles (惊) everyone (人) was inspired by the story of a rural scholar who, after years of obscurity, stunned the imperial court with his brilliance. The metaphor draws from ancient Chinese ornithology, where certain birds were known to remain silent for long periods before producing remarkably beautiful songs. In imperial examination culture, it became associated with candidates who achieved unexpected success. Modern usage extends to any dramatic debut or breakthrough - from artists releasing career-defining works to researchers making groundbreaking discoveries. It captures the universal experience of hidden potential suddenly revealed.",

It originated during the Eastern Han Dynasty, appearing in the biography of statesman Yang Chen. After declining several official appointments, Yang explained that fine wood requires longer to season and superior vessels need more time to craft. The concept gained prominence during the Song Dynasty when it was used to reassure late-blooming scholars. Unlike idioms celebrating prodigies, this one specifically values development requiring extended maturation. Modern applications span career development, education, and personal growth, reminding us that significant accomplishments often emerge from lengthy preparation rather than early brilliance.",

During the Tang Dynasty, as Buddhism flourished, the phrase entered secular contexts to describe exceptional admiration. Unlike terms for simple respect, it specifically describes adoration approaching religious devotion. Modern usage describes extreme admiration or hero-worship, particularly toward cultural icons, intellectual figures, or industry pioneers whose achievements inspire profound reverence.",

     "description_tr": "This precarious idiom describes the difficulty of dismounting (難下) once riding (騎) a tiger (虎), originating from Tang Dynasty political commentary. It illustrated how beginning dangerous enterprises creates situations where stopping becomes more perilous than continuing. The tiger metaphor perfectly captured both power and danger—riding provides temporary advantage but creates a deadly dismount problem. During the Song Dynasty, historical chronicles used it to analyze how rulers became trapped in policies they couldn't safely abandon. Unlike terms for simple difficulty, it specifically addresses situations where the process of extraction appears more dangerous than continuation. Modern usage describes commitments that cannot be safely abandoned despite recognizing their inherent danger, particularly courses of action where both continuation and cessation present significant risks.",
